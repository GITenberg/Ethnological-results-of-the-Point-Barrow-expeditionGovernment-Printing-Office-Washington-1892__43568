<p>The International Polar Expedition to Point Barrow, Alaska, was
organized in 1881 by the Chief Signal Officer of the Army, for the
purpose of cooperating in the work of circumpolar observation proposed
by the International Polar Conference. The expedition, which was
commanded by Lieut. P.&nbsp;H. Ray, Eighth Infantry, U.S.&nbsp;Army,
sailed from San Francisco July 18, 1881, and reached Cape Smyth, 11
miles southwest of Point Barrow, on September 8 of the same year. Here a
permanent station was established, where the party remained until August
28, 1883, when the station was abandoned, and the party sailed for San
Francisco, arriving there October 7.</p>

<p>Though the main object of the expedition was the prosecution of the
observations in terrestrial magnetism and meteorology, it was possible
to obtain a large collection of articles illustrating the arts and
industries of the Eskimo of the region, with whom the most friendly
relations were early established. Nearly all of the collection was made
by barter, the natives bringing their weapons, clothing, and other
objects to the station for sale. Full notes on the habits and customs of
the Eskimo also were collected by the different members of the party,
especially by the commanding officer; the interpreter, Capt. E.&nbsp;P.
Herendeen; the surgeon, Dr. George Scott Oldmixon, and myself, who
served as one of the naturalists and observers of the expedition. It
fell to my share to take charge of and catalogue all the collections
made by the expedition, and therefore I had especially favorable
opportunities for becoming acquainted with the ethnography of the
region. Consequently, upon the return of the expedition, when it was
found that the ethnological observations would occupy too much space for
publication in the official report,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id =
"tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> all the collections and notes were
intrusted to me for the purpose of preparing a special report. The
Smithsonian Institution, through the kindness of the late Prof. Spencer
F.&nbsp;Baird, then secretary, furnished
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page20" id = "page20">
20</a></span>
a room where the work of studying the collection could be carried on,
and allowed me access to its libraries and to the extensive collections
of the National Museum for the purposes of comparison. The Director of
the Bureau of Ethnology, Maj. J.&nbsp;W. Powell, kindly agreed to
furnish the illustrations for the work and to publish it as part of his
annual report, while the Chief Signal Officer, with the greatest
consideration, permitted me to remain in the employ of his Bureau until
the completion of the work.</p>

<p>Two years were spent in a detailed analytical study of the articles
in the collection, until all the information that could be gathered from
the objects themselves and from the notes of the collectors had been
recorded. Careful comparisons were made with the arts and industries of
the Eskimo race as illustrated by the collections in the National Museum
and the writings of various explorers, and these frequently resulted in
the elucidation of obscure points in the history of the Point Barrow
Eskimo. In the form in which it is presented this work contains, it is
believed, all that is known at the present day of the ethnography of
this interesting people.</p>

<p>Much linguistic material was also collected, which I hope some time
to be able to prepare for publication.</p>

<p>The <a name = "ortho" id = "ortho">observations</a> are arranged
according to the plan proposed by Prof. Otis T.&nbsp;Mason in his
“Ethnological Directions, etc.,” somewhat modified to suit the
circumstances. In writing Eskimo words the alphabet given in Powell’s
“Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages” has been used, with the
addition <i>ɐ</i> for an obscure <i>a</i> (like the final <i>a</i> in
<i>soda</i>), <i>ǝ</i> for a similar obscure <i>e</i>, and <i>ö</i> for
the sound of the German <i>ö</i> or French <i>eu</i>.</p>

<p>I desire to express my gratitude to the late Prof. Spencer
F.&nbsp;Baird, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to the late
Gen. William B.&nbsp;Hazen, Chief Signal Officer of the Army, and to
Maj. J.&nbsp;W. Powell, Director of the Bureau of Ethnology, for their
kindness in enabling me to carry on these investigations. Grateful
acknowledgment is due for valuable assistance to various members of the
scientific staff of the National Museum, especially to the curator of
ethnology, Prof. Otis T.&nbsp;Mason, and to Mr. William H.&nbsp;Dall.
Valuable suggestions were received from Mr. Lucien M.&nbsp;Turner, Dr.
Franz Boas, the late Dr. Emil Bessels, and Dr. H.&nbsp;Rink, of
Christiania.</p>

WORKS CONSULTED.</a></h4>

<p>The following list is not intended for a complete bibliography of
what has been written on the ethnography of the Eskimo, but it is
believed that it contains most of the important works by authors who
have treated of these people from personal observation. Such of the less
important works have been included as contain any references bearing
upon the subject of the study.</p>

<h3><a name = "situation" id = "situation" href = "#top">SITUATION AND
SURROUNDINGS.</a></h3>

<p>The people whose arts and industries are represented by the
collection to be described are the Eskimo of the northwestern extremity
of the continent of North America, who make permanent homes at the two
villages of Nuwŭk and Utkiavwĭñ. Small contributions to the collection
were obtained from natives of Wainwright Inlet and from people of the
Inland River (Nunatañmiun) who visited the northern villages.</p>

<p>Nuwŭk, “the Point,” is situated on a slightly elevated knoll at the
extremity of Point Barrow, in lat. 71° 23´ N., long. 156° 17´ W., and
Utkiavwĭñ, “the Cliffs,” at the beginning of the high land at Cape
Smyth, 11 miles southwest from Nuwŭk. The name Utkiavwĭñ was explained
as meaning “the high place, whence one can look out,” and was said to be
equivalent to ĭkpĭk, a&nbsp;cliff. This name appears on the various maps
of this region under several corrupted forms, due to carelessness or
inability to catch the finer distinctions of sound. It first appears on
Capt. Maguire’s map<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a> as “Ot-ki-a-wing,” a&nbsp;form of the word very near the
Eskimo pronunciation. On Dr. Simpson’s map<a class = "tag" name = "tag3"
id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a> it is changed to “Ot-ke-a-vik,” which
on the admiralty chart is misprinted “Otkiovik.” Petroff on his map<a
class = "tag" name = "tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> calls it
“Ootiwakh,” while he gives an imaginary village “Ootkaiowik, Arctic
Ocean,” of 55 inhabitants, in his census of the Arctic Division
(op.&nbsp;cit., p.&nbsp;4), which does not appear upon his map.</p>

<p>Our party, I regret to say, is responsible for the name “Ooglaamie”
or “Uglaamie,” which has appeared on many maps since our return.
Strictly speaking this name should be used only as the official name of
the United States signal station. It arose from a misunderstanding of
the name as heard the day after we arrived, and was even adopted by the
natives in talking with us. It was not until the second year that we
learned the correct form of the word, which has been carefully
verified.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of these two villages are so widely separated from
their neighbors&mdash;the nearest permanent villages are at Point
Belcher and Wainwright Inlet, 75 miles southwest, and Demarcation Point,
350 miles east<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href =
"#note5">5</a>&mdash;and so closely connected with each other by
intermarriage and common interests, that they may be considered as a
single people. In their hunting and trading expeditions they habitually
range from the neighborhood of Refuge Inlet along the coast to Barter
Island, going inland to the upper waters of the large rivers which flow
northward into the Arctic Ocean east of Point Barrow. Small parties
occasionally travel as far as Wainwright Inlet and more rarely to Point
Hope, and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page27" id = "page27">
27</a></span>
some times as far as the Mackenzie River. The extent of their wanderings
will be treated of more fully in connection with their relations to the
other natives of the Northwest. They appear to be unacquainted with the
interior except for about 100 miles south of Point Barrow.</p>

<p>The coast from Refuge Inlet runs nearly straight in a generally
northeast direction to Point Barrow, and consists of steep banks of
clay, gravel, and pebbles, in appearance closely resembling glacial
drift, bordered by a narrow, steep beach of pebbles and gravel, and
broken at intervals by steep gulleys which are the channels of temporary
streams running only during the period of melting snow, and by long,
narrow, and shallow lagoons, to whose edges the cliffs slope gradually
down, sometimes ending in low, steep banks. The mouths of these lagoons
are generally rather wide, and closed by a bar of gravel thrown up by
the waves during the season of open water. In the spring, the snow and
ice on the land melt months before the sea opens and flood the ice on
the lagoons, which also melts gradually around the edges until there is
a sufficient head of water in the lagoon to break through the bar at the
lowest point. This stream soon cuts itself a channel, usually about 20
or 30 yards wide, through which the lagoon is rapidly drained, soon
cutting out an open space of greater or less extent in the sea ice.
Before the sea opens the lagoon is drained down to its level, and the
tide ebbs and flows through the channel, which is usually from knee-deep
to waist-deep, so that the lagoon becomes more or less brackish. When
the sea gets sufficiently open for waves to break upon the beach, they
in a short time bring in enough gravel to close the outlet. The cliffs
gradually decrease in height till they reach Cape Smyth, where they are
about 25 feet high, and terminate in low knolls sloping down to the
banks of the broad lagoon Isûtkwɐ, which is made by the confluence of
two narrow, sinuous gulleys, and is only 10 feet deep in the deepest
part.</p>

<p>Rising from the beach beyond the mouth of this lagoon is a slight
elevation, 12 feet above the sea level, which was anciently the site of
a small village, called by the same name as the lagoon. On this
elevation was situated the United States signal station of Ooglaamie.
Beyond this the land is level with the top of the beach, which is broad
and nearly flat, raised into a slight ridge on the outer edge. About
half a mile from the station, just at the edge of the beach, is the
small lagoon Imérnyɐ, about 200 yards in diameter, and nearly filled up
with marsh. From this point the land slopes down to Elson Bay,
a&nbsp;shallow body of water inclosed by the sandspit which forms Point
Barrow. This is a continuation of the line of the beach, varying in
breadth from 200 to 600 yards and running northeast for 5 miles, then
turning sharply to the east-southeast and running out in a narrow gravel
spit, 2&nbsp;miles long, which is continued eastward by a chain of
narrow, low, sandy islands, which extend as far as Point Tangent. At the
angle of the point the land is slightly elevated into irregular
turf-covered knolls, on which the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page28" id = "page28">
28</a></span>
village of Nuwŭk is situated. At various points along the beach are
heaps of gravel, sometimes 5 or 6 feet in height, which are raised by
the ice. Masses of old ice, bearing large quantities of gravel, are
pushed up on the beach during severe storms and melt rapidly in the
summer, depositing their load of gravel and pebbles in a heap. These
masses are often pushed up out of reach of the waves, so that the heaps
of gravel are left thenceforth undisturbed.</p>

<p>Between Imernyɐ and Elson Bay (Tă´syûk) is a series of large shallow
lagoons, nearly circular and close to the beach, which rises in a
regular sea-wall. All have low steep banks on the land side, bordered
with a narrow beach. The first of these, I´kpĭlĭñ (“that which has high
banks”), breaks out in the spring through a narrow channel in the beach
in the manner already described, and is salt or brackish. The next is
fresh and connected with I´kpĭlĭñ by a small stream running along behind
the beach. It is called Sĭ´n-nyû, and receives a rivulet from a small
fresh-water lake 3 or 4 miles inland. The third, Imê´kpûñ (“great
water”), is also fresh, and has neither tributary nor outlet. The
fourth, Imêkpû´niglu, is brackish, and empties into Elson Bay by a small
stream. Between this stream and the beach is a little fresh-water pond
close to the bend of Elson Bay, which is called Kĭkyûktă´ktoro, from one
or two little islands (kĭkyû´ktɐ) near one end of it.</p>

<p>Back from the shore the land is but slightly elevated, and is marshy
and interspersed with many small lakes and ponds, sometimes connected by
inconsiderable streams. This marsh passes gradually into a somewhat
higher and drier rolling plain, stretching back inland from the cliffs
and growing gradually higher to the south. Dr. Simpson, on the authority
of the Point Barrow natives, describes the country as “uniformly low,
and full of small lakes or pools of fresh water to a distance of about
50 miles from the north shore, where the surface becomes undulating and
hilly, and, farther south, mountainous.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag6"
id = "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a> This description has been
substantially verified by Lieut. Ray’s explorations. South of the usual
deer-hunting ground of the natives he found the land decidedly broken
and hilly, and rising gradually to a considerable range of mountains,
running approximately east and west, which could be seen from the
farthest point he reached.<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7"
href = "#note7">7</a></p>

<p>The natives also speak of high rocky land “a long way off to the
east,” which some of them have visited for the purpose of hunting the
mountain sheep. The low rolling plain in the immediate vicinity of Point
Barrow, which is all of the country that could be visited by our party
when the land was clear of snow, presents the general appearance of a
country overspread with glacial drift. The landscape is strikingly like
the rolling drift hills of Cape Cod, and this resemblance is increased
by the absence of trees and the occurrence of ponds in all the
depressions. There are no rocks in situ visible in this region, and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page29" id = "page29">
29</a></span>
large bowlders are absent, while pebbles larger than the fist are rare.
The surface of the ground is covered with a thin soil, supporting a
rather sparse vegetation of grass, flowering plants, creeping willows,
and mosses, which is thicker on the higher hillsides and forms a layer
of turf about a foot thick. Large tracts of comparatively level ground
are almost bare of grass, and consist of irregular hummocks of black,
muddy soil, scantily covered with light-colored lichens and full of
small pools. The lowlands, especially those back of the beach lagoons,
are marshes, thickly covered with grass and sphagnum. The whole surface
of the land is exceedingly wet in summer, except the higher knolls and
hillsides, and for about 100 yards back from the edge of the cliffs. The
thawing, however, extends down only about a foot or eighteen inches.
Beyond this depth the ground is perpetually frozen for an unknown
distance. There are no streams of any importance in the immediate
neighborhood of Point Barrow. On the other hand, three of the rivers
emptying into the Arctic Ocean between Point Barrow and the Colville,
which Dr. Simpson speaks of as “small and hardly known except to persons
who have visited them,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href =
"#note8">8</a> have been found to be considerable streams. Two of these
were visited by Lieut. Ray in his exploring trips in 1882 and 1883. The
first, Kua´ru, is reached after traveling about 50 miles from Point
Barrow in a southerly direction. It has been traced only for a small
part of its course, and there is reason to believe, from what the
natives say, that it is a tributary of the second named river. Lieut.
Ray visited the upper part of the second river, Kulugrua (named by him
“Meade River”), in March, 1882, when he went out to join the native deer
hunters encamped on its banks, just on the edge of the hilly country. On
his return he visited what the natives assured him was the mouth of this
river, and obtained observations for its geographical position. Early in
April, 1883, he again visited the upper portion of the stream, and
traced it back some distance into the hilly country. The intermediate
portion has never been surveyed. At the time of each of his visits the
river was, of course, frozen and the ground covered with snow, but he
was able to see that the river was of considerable size, upwards of 200
yards wide where he first reached it, about 60 miles from its mouth, and
showing evidences of a large volume of water in the spring. It receives
several tributaries. (See maps, <a href = "PointBarrow.html#plateI">Pls.
<span class = "smallroman">I</span></a> and <a href =
"PointBarrow.html#plateII"><span class =
"smallroman">II</span>.</a>)</p>

<p>The third river is known only by hearsay from the natives. It is
called Ĭ´kpĭkpûñ (Great Cliff), and is about 40 miles (estimated from
day’s journeys) east of Kulu´grua. It is described as being a larger and
more rapid stream than the other two, and so deep that it does not
freeze down to the bottom on the shallow bars, as they say Kulu´grua
does. Not far from its mouth it is said to receive a tributary from the
east flowing out of a great lake of fresh water, called Tă´syûkpûñ
(Great Lake.) This lake is separated from the sea by a comparatively
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page30" id = "page30">
30</a></span>
narrow strip of land, and is so large that a man standing on the
northern shore can not see the “very high” land on the southern. It
takes an umiak a day to travel the length of the lake under sail with a
fair wind, and when the Nunatañmiun coming from the south first saw the
lake they said “Taxaio!” (the sea).</p>

<p>On Capt. Maguire’s map<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href
= "#note9">9</a> this lake is laid down by the name “Taso´kpoh” “from
native report.” It is represented as lying between Smith Bay and
Harrison Bay, and connected with each by a stream. Maguire seems to have
heard nothing of Ikpikpûñ. This lake is not mentioned in the body of the
report. Dr. Simpson, however,<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" id =
"tag10" href = "#note10">10</a> speaks of it in the following words:
“They [i.e., the trading parties when they reach Smith Bay] enter a
river which conducts them to a lake, or rather series of lakes, and
descend another stream which joins the sea in Harrison Bay.” They are
well acquainted with the Colville River, which in their intercourse with
us they usually called “the river at Nĭ´galĕk,” Nĭ´galĕk being the well
known name of the trading camp at the mouth. It was also sometimes
spoken of as the “river of the Nunatañmiun.” The Mackenzie River is
known as “Kupûñ” (great river). We found them also acquainted with the
large unexplored river called “Kok” on the maps, which flows into
Wainwright Inlet. They called it “Ku” (the river). The river “Cogrua,”
which is laid down on the charts as emptying into Peard Bay, was never
mentioned by the Point Barrow natives, but we were informed by Capt.
Gifford, of the whaler <i>Daniel Webster</i>, who traveled along the
coast from Point Barrow to Cape Lisburne after the loss of his vessel in
1881, that it is quite a considerable stream. He had to ascend it for
about a day’s journey&mdash;20 miles, according to Capt. Hooper<a class
= "tag" name = "tag11" id = "tag11" href = "#note11">11</a>&mdash;before
he found it shallow enough to ford.</p>


<h3><a name = "climate" id = "climate" href = "#top">CLIMATE.</a></h3>

<p>The climate of this region is thoroughly arctic in character, the
mean annual temperature being 8° F., ranging from 65° to <span class =
"locked">-52°</span> F.&nbsp;Such temperatures as the last mentioned
are, however, rare, the ordinary winter temperature being between <span
class = "locked">-20°</span> and <span class = "locked">-30°</span> F.,
rarely rising during December, January, February, and March as high as
zero, and still more rarely passing beyond it. The winter merges
insensibly by slow degrees into summer, with occasional “cold snaps,”
and frosty nights begin again by the 1st of September.</p>

<p>The sun is entirely below the horizon at Point Barrow for 72 days in
the winter, beginning November 15, though visible by refraction a day or
two later at the beginning of this period and a day or two earlier at
the end. The midday darkness is never complete even at the winter
solstice, as the sun is such a short distance below the horizon, but the
time suitable for outdoor employments is limited to a short twilight
from 9 a.m.&nbsp;to 3 p.m.&nbsp;There is, of course, an equal time in
the summer
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page31" id = "page31">
31</a></span>
when the sun is continually above the horizon, and for about a month
before and after this period the twilight is so bright all night that no
stars are visible.</p>

<p>The snowfall during the winter is comparatively small. There is
probably not more than a foot of snow on a level anywhere on the land,
though it is extremely difficult to measure or estimate, as it is so
fine and dry that it is easily moved by the wind and is constantly in
motion, forming deep, heavy, hard drifts under all the banks, while many
exposed places, especially the top of the sand beach, are swept entirely
clean. The snow begins to soften and melt about the first week in April,
but goes off very slowly, so that the ground is not wholly bare before
the middle or end of June. The grass, however, begins to turn green
early in June, and a few flowers are seen in blossom as early as June 7
or 8.</p>

<p>Rain begins to fall as early as April, but cold, snowy days are not
uncommon later than that date. There is a good deal of clear, calm
weather during the winter, and extremely low temperatures are seldom
accompanied by high wind. Violent storms are not uncommon, however,
especially in November, during the latter part of January, and in
February. One gale from the south and southwest, which occurred January
22, 1882, reached a velocity of 100 miles an hour. The most agreeable
season of the year is between the middle of May and the end of July,
when the sea opens. After this there is much foggy and cloudy
weather.</p>

<p>Fresh-water ponds begin to freeze about the last week in September,
and by the first or second week in October everything is sufficiently
frozen for the natives to travel with sledges to fish through the ice of
the inland rivers. Melting begins with the thawing of the snow, but the
larger ponds are not clear of ice till the middle or end of July. The
sea in most seasons is permanently closed by freezing and the moving in
of heavy ice fields from about the middle of October to the end of July.
The heavy ice in ordinary seasons does not move very far from the shore,
while the sea is more or less encumbered with floating masses all
summer. These usually ground on a bar which runs from the Seahorse
Islands along the shore parallel to it and about 1,000 yards distant,
forming a “barrier” or “land-floe” of high, broken hummocks, inshore of
which the sea freezes over smooth and undisturbed by the pressure of the
outer pack.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the heavy pack, under the pressure of violent and
long-continued westerly winds, pushes across the bar and is forced up on
the beach. The ice sometimes comes in with great rapidity. The natives
informed us that a year or two before the station was established the
heavy ice came in against the village cliffs, tearing away part of the
bank and destroying a house on the edge of the cliff so suddenly that
one of the inmates, a&nbsp;large, stout man, was unable to escape
through the trap-door and was crushed to death. Outside of the land-floe
the ice is a broken pack, consisting of hummocks of fragmentary old and
new ice, interspersed with comparatively level fields of the former.
During the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page32" id = "page32">
32</a></span>
early part of the winter this pack is most of the time in motion,
sometimes moving northeastward with the prevailing current and grinding
along the edge of the barrier, sometimes moving off to sea before an
offshore wind, leaving “leads” of open water, which in calm weather are
immediately covered with new ice (at&nbsp;the rate of 6 inches in 24
hours), and again coming in with greater or less violence against the
edges of this new ice, crushing and crumpling it up against the barrier.
Portions of the land-floe even float off and move away with the pack at
this season.</p>

<p>The westerly gales of the later winter, however, bring in great
quantities of ice, which, pressing against the land-floe, are pushed up
into hummocks and ground firmly in deeper water, thus increasing the
breadth of the fixed land-floe until the line of separation between the
land-floe and the moving pack is 4 or 5 or sometimes even 8 miles from
land. The hummocks of the land-floe show a tendency to arrange
themselves in lines parallel to the shore, and if the pressure has not
been too great there are often fields of ice of the season not over 4
feet thick between the ranges of hummocks, as was the case in the winter
of 1881-’82. In the following year, however, the pressure was so great
that there were no such fields, and even the level ice inside of the
barrier was crushed into hummocks in many places.</p>

<p>After the gales are over there is generally less motion in the pack,
until about the middle of April, when easterly winds usually cause leads
to open at the edge of the land-floe. These leads now continue to open
and shut, varying in size with the direction and force of the wind. As
the season advances, especially in July, the melting of the ice on the
surface loosens portions of the land-floe, which float off and join the
pack, bringing the leads nearer to the shore. In the meantime the level
shore ice has been cut away from the beach by the warm water running
down from the land and has grown “rotten” and full of holes from the
heat of the sun. By the time the outside ice has moved away so as to
leave only the floes grounded on the bar the inside ice breaks up into
loose masses, moving up and down with wind and current and ready to move
off through the first break in the barrier. Portions of the remaining
barrier gradually break off and at last the whole finally floats and
moves out with the pack, sometimes, as in 1881&mdash;a very remarkable
season&mdash;moving out of sight from the land.</p>

<p>This final departure of the ice may take place at any time between
the middle of July and the middle of August. East of Point Barrow we had
opportunities only for hasty and superficial observations of the state
of the ice. The land floe appears to form some distance outside of the
sandy islands, and from the account of the natives there is much open
water along shore early in the season, caused by the breaking up of the
rivers. Dr. Simpson<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href =
"#note12">12</a> learned from the natives that the trading parties which
left the Point about the 1st of July found open water at Dease Inlet.
This is more definite information than we were able to obtain. We only
learned that they counted on finding open water a few days’ journey
east.</p>

<p>In stature these people are of a medium height, robust and muscular,
“inclining rather to spareness than corpulence,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag13" id = "tag13" href = "#note13">13</a> though the fullness of the
face and the thick fur clothing often gives the impression of the
latter. There is, however, considerable individual variation among them
in this respect. The women are as a rule shorter than the men,
occasionally almost dwarfish, though some women are taller than many of
the men. The tallest man observed measured 5 feet 9½ inches, and the
shortest 4 feet 11 inches. The tallest woman was 5 feet 3 inches in
height, and the shortest 4 feet ½ inch. The heaviest man weighed 204
pounds and the lightest 126 pounds. One woman weighed 192 pounds and the
shortest woman was also the lightest, weighing only 100 pounds.<a class

and feet are small and well shaped, though the former soon become
distorted and roughened by work. We did not observe the peculiar breadth
of hands noticed by Dr. Simpson, nor is the shortness of the thumb which
he mentions sufficient to attract attention.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag15" id = "tag15" href = "#note15">15</a> Their feet are so small
that only one of our party, who is much below the ordinary size, was
able to wear the boots made by the natives for themselves. Small and
delicate hands and feet appear to be a universal characteristic of the
Eskimo race and have been mentioned by most observers from Greenland to
Alaska.<a class = "tag" name = "tag16" id = "tag16" href =

<p>The face is broad, flat, and round, with high cheek bones and rather
low forehead, broad across the brow and narrowing above, while the head
is somewhat pointed toward the crown. The peculiar shape of the head is
somewhat masked by the way of wearing the hair, and is best seen in the
skull. The nose is short, with little or no bridge (few Eskimo were able
to wear our spring eye-glasses), and broad, especially across the alæ
nasæ, with a peculiar rounded, somewhat bulbous tip,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page36" id = "page36">
36</a></span>
and large nostrils. The eyes are horizontal,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag19" id = "tag19" href = "#note19">19</a> with rather full lids, and
are but slightly sunken below the level of the face.</p>

<p>The mouth is large and the lips full, especially the under one. The
teeth are naturally large, and in youth are white and generally regular,
but by middle age they are generally worn down to flat-crowned stumps,
as is usual among the Eskimo. The color of the skin is a light yellowish
brown, with often considerable ruddy color on the cheeks and lips. There
appears to be much natural variation in the complexion, some women being
nearly as fair as Europeans, while other individuals seem to have
naturally a coppery color.<a class = "tag" name = "tag20" id = "tag20"
href = "#note20">20</a> In most cases the complexion appears darker than
it really is from the effects of exposure to the weather. All sunburn
very easily, especially in the spring when there is a strong reflection
from the snow.</p>

Utkiavwiñ.</p>

<p>The old are much wrinkled, and they frequently suffer from watery
eyes, with large sacks under them, which begin to form at a
comparatively early age. There is considerable variation in features, as
well as complexion, among them, even in cases where there seems to be no
suspicion of mixed blood. There were several men among them with decided
aquiline noses and something of a Hebrew cast of countenance. The eyes
are of various shades of dark brown&mdash;two pairs of light hazel eyes
were observed&mdash;and are often handsome. The hair is black, perfectly
straight, and very thick. With the men it is generally coarser than with
the women, who sometimes have very long and silky hair, though it
generally does not reach much below the shoulders. The eyebrows are thin
and the beard scanty, growing mostly upon the upper lip and chin, and
seldom appearing under the age of 20. In this they resemble most Eskimo.
Back,<a class = "tag" name = "tag21" id = "tag21" href =
"#note21">21</a> however, speaks of the “luxuriant
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page38" id = "page38">
38</a></span>
beards and flowing mustaches” of the Eskimo of the Great Fish River.
Some of the older men have rather heavy black mustaches, but there is
much variation in this respect. The upper part of the body (as&nbsp;much
is commonly exposed in the house) is remarkably free from hair. The
general expression is good humored and attractive.</p>

<p>The males, even when very young, are remarkable for their graceful
and dignified carriage. The body is held erect, with the shoulders
square and chest well thrown out, the knees straight, and the feet
firmly planted on the ground. In walking they move with long swinging
elastic strides, the toes well turned out and the arms swinging.</p>

<p>I can not agree with Dr. Simpson that the turning out of the toes
gives “a&nbsp;certain peculiarity to their gait difficult to
describe.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag22" id = "tag22" href =
"#note22">22</a> I&nbsp;should say that they walked like well built
athletic white men. The women, on the other hand, although possessing
good physiques, are singularly ungraceful in their movements. They walk
at a sort of shuffling half-trot, with the toes turned in, the body
leaning forward, and the arms hanging awkwardly.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag23" id = "tag23" href = "#note23">23</a></p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Woman stretching
skins.</p>

<p>A noticeable thing about the women is the remarkable flexibility of
the body and limbs, and the great length of time they can stand in a
stooping posture. (See Fig. 5&nbsp;for a posture often assumed in
working.) Both men and women have a very fair share of muscular
strength. Some of the women, especially, showed a power of carrying
heavy loads superior to most white men. We were able to make no other
comparisons of their strength with ours. Their power of endurance is
very great, and both sexes are capable of making long distances on foot.
Two men sometimes spend 24 hours tramping through the rough ice in
search of seals, and we knew of instances where small parties made
journeys of 50 or 75 miles on foot without stopping to sleep.</p>

<p>The women are not prolific. Although all the adults are or have been
married, many of them are childless, and few have more than two
children. One woman was known to have at least four, but investigations
of this sort were rendered extremely difficult by the universal custom
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page39" id = "page39">
39</a></span>
of adoption. Dr. Simpson heard of a “rare case” where one woman had
borne seven children.<a class = "tag" name = "tag24" id = "tag24" href =
"#note24">24</a> We heard of no twins at either village, though we
obtained the Eskimo word for twins. It was impossible to learn with
certainty the age at which the women first bear children, from the
impossibility of learning the age of any individuals in the absence of
any fixed method of reckoning time. Dr. Simpson states that they do not
commonly bear children before the age of 20,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag25" id = "tag25" href = "#note25">25</a> and we certainly saw no
mothers who appeared younger than this. We knew of but five cases of
pregnancy in the two villages during the 2 years of our stay. Of these,
one suffered miscarriage, and of the other four, only two of the infants
lived more than a short time. It is exceedingly difficult, for the
reasons stated above, to form any estimate of the age to which these
people live, though it is natural to suppose that the arduous and often
precarious existence which they lead must prevent any great longevity.
Men and women who appeared to be 60 or over were rare. Yûksĭ´ña, the
so-called “chief” of Nuwŭk, who was old enough to be a man of
considerable influence at the time the <i>Plover</i> wintered at Point
Barrow (1852-’54), was in 1881 a feeble, bowed, tottering old man, very
deaf and almost blind, but with his mental faculties apparently
unimpaired. Gray hair appears uncommon. Even the oldest are, as a rule,
but slightly gray.</p>


<h5><a name = "people_physical_pathology" id =
"people_physical_pathology" href =
"#people_physical">PATHOLOGY.</a></h5>

<p>Diseases of the respiratory and digestive organs are the most
frequent and serious ailments from which they suffer. The former are
most prevalent toward the end of summer and early in winter, and are due
to the natives sleeping on the damp ground and to their extreme
carelessness in exposing themselves to drafts of wind when overheated.
Nearly everyone suffers from coughs and colds in the latter part of
August, and many deaths occur at this season and the beginning of winter
from a disease which appears to be pneumonia. A&nbsp;few cases, one
fatal, of hemorrhage of the lungs were observed, which were probably
aggravated by the universal habit of inhaling tobacco smoke. The people
suffer from diarrhea, indigestion, and especially from constipation.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea appears common in both sexes, but syphilis seems to be
unknown in spite of the promiscuous intercourse of the women with the
whalemen. One case of uterine hemorrhage was observed. Cutaneous
diseases are rare. A&nbsp;severe ulcer on the leg, of long standing, was
cured by our surgeon, to whose observations I am chiefly indebted for
what I have to say about the diseases of these people; and one man had
lost the cartilage of his nose and was marked all over the body with
hideous scars from what appeared to be some form of scrofulous disease.
A&nbsp;single case of tumor on the deltoid muscle was observed.
Rheumatism is rather frequent. All are subject to snow blindness in the
spring, and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page40" id = "page40">
40</a></span>
sores on the face from neglected frost bites are common. Many are blind
in one eye from what appears to be cataract or leucoma, but only one
case of complete blindness was noticed. Dr. Sutherland states that he
does not recollect a single instance of total blindness among the Eskimo
that he saw in Baffin Land, and expresses the opinion that “An
individual in such a state would be quite unfit for the life of toil and
hardship to which the hardy Esquimaux is exposed. The neglect consequent
upon this helpless condition most probably cuts off its afflicted
objects.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag26" id = "tag26" href =
"#note26">26</a></p>

<p>This seems quite reasonable on a priori grounds, but nevertheless the
blind man at Cape Smyth had lived to middle age in very comfortable
circumstances, and though supported to a great extent by his relatives
he was nevertheless able to do a certain share of work, and had the
reputation of being a good paddler for a whaling umiak.</p>

<p>Injuries are rare. One man had lost both feet at the ankle and moved
about with great ease and rapidity on his knees. All are subject to
bleeding at the nose and usually plug the bleeding nostril with a bunch
of deer hair.<a class = "tag" name = "tag27" id = "tag27" href =
"#note27">27</a></p>

<p>This habit, as it has been termed, of vicarious hemorrhage seems to
be characteristic of the Eskimo race wherever they have been met with,
and has been supposed to be a process of nature for relieving the
fullness of the circulatory system caused by their exclusively animal
diet.<a class = "tag" name = "tag28" id = "tag28" href =
"#note28">28</a></p>

<p>Natural deformities and abnormalities of structure are uncommon,
except strabismus, which is common and often, at least, congenital. One
boy in Utkiavwĭñ had his forehead twisted to one side, probably from
some accident or difficulty during delivery. His intelligence did not
seem to be impaired. The people are, as a rule, right handed, but that
left-handed persons occasionally occur is shown by their having a word
for a left-handed man. We also collected a “crooked knife,” fitted for
use with the left hand.<a class = "tag" name = "tag29" id = "tag29" href
= "#note29">29</a></p>


<h4><a name = "people_psychical" id = "people_psychical" href =
"#people">PSYCHICAL CHARACTERISTICS.</a></h4>

<p>As a rule they are quick-witted and intelligent, and show a great
capacity for appreciating and learning useful things, especially
mechanical arts. In disposition they are light-hearted and cheerful, not
easily cast down by sorrow or misfortune, and though sometimes
quick-tempered, their anger seldom lasts long.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag30" id = "tag30" href = "#note30">30</a> They have a very keen sense
of humor, and are fond of practical jokes, which they take in good part,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page41" id = "page41">
41</a></span>
even when practiced on themselves. They are generally peaceable. We did
not witness a single quarrel among the men during the two years of our
stay, though they told us stories of fatal quarrels in former years, in
which firearms were used. Liquor may have been the cause of these
fights, as it is said to have been of the only suicide I ever heard of
among them, which I am informed by Capt. E.&nbsp;E. Smith, the whaling
master already referred to, occurred in 1885 at Nuwŭk. Disagreements
between man and wife, however, sometimes lead to blows, in which the man
does not always get the best of it.</p>

<p>When the station was first established many of the natives began
pilfering from our stores, but they soon learned that by so doing they
cut themselves off from the privilege of visiting the station and
enjoying the opportunity for trading which it afforded, and were glad to
promise to refrain from the practice. This promise was very well
observed, though I think wholly from feelings of self-interest, as the
thieves when detected seemed to have no feeling of shame. Some,
I&nbsp;believe, never yielded to the temptation. There was seldom any
difficulty in obtaining restitution of stolen articles, as the thief’s
comrades would not attempt to shield him, but often voluntarily betrayed
him. They acknowledged that there was considerable thieving on board of
the ships, but the men of Utkiavwĭñ tried to lay the blame on the Nuwŭk
people, and we may suppose that the charge was reciprocated, as was the
case regarding the theft of the <i>Plover’s</i> sails.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag31" id = "tag31" href = "#note31">31</a> We also heard of
occasional thefts among themselves, especially of seals left on the ice
or venison buried in the snow, but men who were said to be thieves did
not appear to lose any social consideration.</p>

<p>Robbery with violence appears to be unknown. We never saw or heard of
the “burglar-alarm” described by Dr. Simpson,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag32" id = "tag32" href = "#note32">32</a> which I am inclined to
believe was really a “demon trap” like that described by Lieut. Ray (see
below, under Religion).</p>

<p>They are in the main truthful, though a detected lie is hardly
considered more than a good joke, and considerable trickery is practiced
in trading. For instance, soon after the station was established they
brought over the carcass of a dog, with the skin, head, feet, and tail
removed, and attempted to sell it for a young reindeer; and when we
began to purchase seal-oil for the lamps one woman brought over a tin
can nearly filled with ice, with merely a layer of oil on top.</p>

<p>Clothing and other articles made especially for sale to us were often
very carelessly and hastily made, while their own things were always
carefully finished.<a class = "tag" name = "tag33" id = "tag33" href =
"#note33">33</a></p>

<p>Their affection for each other, especially for their children, is
strong,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page42" id = "page42">
42</a></span>
though they make little show of grief for bereavement, and their minds
are easily diverted by amusements. I&nbsp;am inclined to believe,
however, from some cases I have observed, that grief is deeper and more
permanent than superficial appearances would indicate.</p>

<p>Their curiosity is unbounded, and they have no hesitation in
gratifying it by unlimited questioning. All who have read the accounts
of the Eskimo character given by explorers in other parts of the Arctic
regions will recognize this as a familiar trait. We also found the habit
of begging at first quite as offensive among some of these people as
other travelers have found it, but as they grew better acquainted with
us they ceased to beg except for trifling things, such as a chew of
tobacco or a match. Some of the better class never begged at all. Some
of them seemed to feel truly grateful for the benefits and gifts
received, and endeavored by their general behavior, as well as in more
substantial ways, to make some adequate return. Others appeared to think
only of what they might receive.</p>

<p>Hospitality is a universal virtue. Many of them, from the beginning
of our acquaintance with them, showed the greatest friendliness and
willingness to assist us in every way, while others, especially if there
were many of them together, were inclined to be insolent, and knives
were occasionally drawn in sudden fits of passion. These “roughs,”
however, soon learned that behavior of this sort was punished by prompt
ostracism and threats of severer discipline, and before the first nine
months were past we had established the most friendly relations with the
whole village at Cape Smyth. Some of those who were at first most
insolent became afterwards our best friends. Living as these people do
at peace with their neighbors, they would not be expected to exhibit the
fierce martial courage of many other savages, but bold whalemen and
venturous ice-hunters can not be said to lack bravery.</p>

<p>In their dealings with white men the richer and more influential
among them at least consider themselves their equals if not their
superiors, and they do not appreciate the attitude of arrogant
superiority adopted by many white men in their intercourse with
so-called savages. Many of them show a grace of manner and a natural
delicacy and politeness which is quite surprising. I&nbsp;have known a
young Eskimo so polite that in conversing with Lieut. Ray he would take
pains to mispronounce his words in the same way as the latter did, so as
not to hurt his feelings by correcting him bluntly.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag34" id = "tag34" href = "#note34">34</a></p>


<h4><a name = "people_tribal" id = "people_tribal" href =
"#people">TRIBAL PHENOMENA.</a></h4>

<p>We were unable to discover among these people the slightest trace of
tribal organization or of division into gentes, and in this our
observations agree with those of all who have studied the Eskimos
elsewhere. They call themselves as a race “In´uĭn,” a&nbsp;term
corresponding to the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page43" id = "page43">
43</a></span>
“Inuit” of other dialects, and meaning “people”, or “human beings”.
Under this name they include white men and Indians as well as Eskimo, as
is the case in Greenland and the Mackenzie River district, and probably
also everywhere else, though many writers have supposed it to be applied
by them only to their own race.</p>

<p>They have however special names for the former two races. The people
of any village are known as “the inhabitants of such and such a place;”
for instance, Nuwŭ´ñmiun, “the inhabitants of the point;” Utkiavwĭñmiun,
“the inhabitants of Utkiávwĭñ;” Kuñmiun (in&nbsp;Greenlandic
“Kungmiut”), “the people who live on the river.” The people about Norton
Sound speak of the northern Eskimo, especially those of Point Barrow and
Cape Smyth, as “Kûñmû´dlĭñ,” which is not a name derived from a
location, but a sort of nickname, the meaning of which was not
ascertained. The Point Barrow natives do not call themselves by this
name, but apply it to those people whose winter village is at
Demarcation Point (or&nbsp;Herschel Island, see above, <a href =
"#page26">p.&nbsp;26</a>). This word appears in the corrupted form
“Kokmullit,” as the name of the village at Nuwŭk on Petroff’s map.
Petroff derived his information regarding the northern coast at
second-hand from people who had obtained their knowledge of names, etc.,
from the natives of Norton Sound.</p>

<p>The people of the two villages under consideration frequently go
backward and forward, sometimes removing permanently from one village to
the other, while strangers from distant villages sometimes winter here,
so that it was not until the end of the second year, when we were
intimately acquainted with everybody at Utkiavwĭñ, that we could form
anything like a correct estimate of the population of this village.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag35" id = "tag35" href = "#note35">35</a> This
we found to be about 140 souls. As well as we could judge, there were
about 150 or 160 at Nuwŭk. These figures show a great decrease in
numbers since the end of 1853, when Dr. Simpson<a class = "tag" name =
"tag36" id = "tag36" href = "#note36">36</a> reckoned the population of
Nuwŭk at 309. During the 2 years from September, 1881, to August, 1883,
there were fifteen deaths that we heard of in the village of Utkiavwĭñ
alone, and only two children born in that period survived. With this
ratio between the number of births and deaths, even in a period of
comparative plenty, it is difficult to see how the race can escape
speedy extinction, unless by accessions from without, which in their
isolated situation they are not likely to receive.<a class = "tag" name

<p>The nearest neighbors of these people, as has been stated above, are
the Eskimo living at Demarcation Point (or&nbsp;Herschel
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page44" id = "page44">
44</a></span>
Island), eastward, and those who inhabit the small villages between
Point Belcher and Wainwright Inlet. These villages are three in number.
The nearest to Point Belcher, Nuna´ria, is now deserted, and its
inhabitants have established the new village of Sida´ru nearer the
inlet. The third village consists of a few houses only, and is called
A´tûnĕ. The people of these villages are so closely connected that they
are sometimes spoken of collectively as Sida´ruñmiun. At a distance up
the river, which flows into Wainwright Inlet, live the Ku´ñmiun, “the
people who live on the river.” These appear to be closely related to the
people of the first village below Wainwright Inlet, which is named
Kĭlauwitawĭñ. At any rate, a&nbsp;party of them who came to Cape Smyth
in the spring of 1883 were spoken of indifferently as Kuñmiun or
Kĭlauwitawĭ´ñmiun.</p>

<p>Small parties from all the villages occasionally visit Point Barrow
during the winter for the purpose of trade and amusement, traveling with
sledges along the land ice where it is smooth, otherwise along the edge
of the cliffs; and similar parties from the two northern villages return
these visits. No special article of trade appears to be sought at either
village, though perhaps the southern villages have a greater supply of
skins of the bearded seal, fit for making umiak covers, as I knew of a
load of these brought up for sale, and in the spring of 1883 a party
went down to the inlet in search of such skins. Single families and
small parties like that from Kĭlauwitawĭñ, mentioned above, sometimes
spend the whaling season at Point Barrow, joining some of the whaling
crews at the northern villages. The people that we saw from these
settlements were very like the northern Eskimos but many of them spoke a
perceptibly harsher dialect, sounding the final consonants
distinctly.</p>

<p>The people at Point Hope are known as Tĭkera´ñmiun “inhabitants of
the forefinger (Point Hope)”, and their settlement is occasionally
visited by straggling parties. No natives from Point Hope came north
during the 2 years of our stay, but a party of them visited the
<i>Plover</i> in 1853.<a class = "tag" name = "tag38" id = "tag38" href

Kuwû´ñmiun and Silawĭ´ñmiun of the Kuwûk (Kowak or “Putnam”) and Silawik
Rivers emptying into Hotham Inlet, and one man was familiar with the
name of Sisualĭñ, the great trading camp at Kotzebue Sound. We were
unable to find that they had any knowledge of Asia (“Kokhlitnuna,”) or
the Siberian Eskimo, but this was probably due to lack of properly
directed inquiries, as they seem to have been well informed on the
subject in the <i>Plover’s</i> time.<a class = "tag" name = "tag39" id =

winter at the northern villages. One family wintered at Nuwŭk in
1881-’82, and another at Utkiavĭñ the following winter, while a widower
of this “tribe” was also settled there for the same winter, having
married a widow in the village. We obtained very little definite
information about these people except that they came from the south and
descended the Colville River. Our investigations were rendered difficult
by the engrossing nature of the work of the station, and the trouble we
experienced, at first, in learning enough of the language to make
ourselves clearly understood. Dr. Simpson was able to learn definitely
that the homes of these people are on the Nunatăk and that some of them
visit Kotzebue Sound in the summer, while trading parties make a portage
between the Nunatăk and Colville, descending the latter river to the
Arctic Ocean.<a class = "tag" name = "tag40" id = "tag40" href =
"#note40">40</a> I&nbsp;have been informed by the captain of one of the
American whalers that he has, in different seasons, met the same people
at Kotzebue Sound and the mouth of the Colville. We also received
articles of Siberian tame reindeer skin from the east, which must have
come across the country from Kotzebue Sound.</p>

<p>These people differ from the northern natives in some habits, which
will be described later, and speak a harsher dialect. We were informed
that in traveling east after passing the mouth of the Colville they came
to the Kûñmû´dlĭñ (“Kangmali enyuin” of Dr. Simpson and other authors)
and still further off “a&nbsp;great distance” to the Kupûñ or “Great
River”&mdash;the Mackenzie&mdash;near the mouth of which is the village
of the Kupûñmiun, whence it is but a short distance inland to the “great
house” (iglu´kpûk) of the white men on the great river (probably Fort
Macpherson). Beyond this we only heard confused stories of people
without posteriors and of sledges that run by themselves without dogs to
draw them. We heard nothing of the country of Kĭtiga´ru<a class = "tag"
name = "tag41" id = "tag41" href = "#note41">41</a> or of the stone-lamp
country mentioned by Dr. Simpson.<a class = "tag" name = "tag42" id =
"tag42" href = "#note42">42</a> The Kûñmûdlĭñ are probably, as Dr.
Simpson believes, the people whose winter houses were seen by Franklin
at Demarcation Point,<a class = "tag" name = "tag43" id = "tag43" href =
"#note43">43</a> near which, at Icy Reef, Hooper also saw a few
houses.<a class = "tag" name = "tag44" id = "tag44" href =
"#note44">44</a></p>

<p>As already stated, Capt. E. E. Smith was informed by the natives that
there is now no village farther west than Herschel Island, where there
is one of considerable size. If he was correctly informed, this must be
a new village, since the older explorers who passed along the coast
found only a summer camp at this point. He also states that he found
large numbers of ruined iglus on the outlying sandy islands along the
coast, especially near Anxiety Point. We have scarcely any information
about these people, as the only white men who have seen them had little
intercourse with them in passing along the coast.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag45" id = "tag45" href = "#note45">45</a> The
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page46" id = "page46">
46</a></span>
Point Barrow people have but slight acquaintance with them, as they see
them only a short time each summer. Captain Smith, however, informs me
that in the summer of 1885 one boat load of them came back with the
Point Barrow traders to Point Barrow, where he saw them on board of his
ship. There was a man at Utkiavwĭñ who was called “the Kûñmû´dlĭñ.” He
came there when a child, probably, by adoption, and was in no way
distinguishable from the other people.</p>

<p>Father Petitot appears to include these people in the “Taρèoρmeut”
division of his “Tchiglit” Eskimo, whom he loosely describes as
inhabiting the coast from Herschel Island to Liverpool Bay, including
the delta of the Mackenzie,<a class = "tag" name = "tag46" id = "tag46"
href = "#note46">46</a> without locating their permanent villages. In
another place, however, he excludes the “Taρèoρmeut” from the
“Tchiglit,” saying, “Dans l’ouest, les <i>Tchiglit</i> communiquaient
avec leurs plus proches voisins les Taρèoρ-meut,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag47" id = "tag47" href = "#note47">47</a> while in a third place<a
class = "tag" name = "tag48" id = "tag48" href = "#note48">48</a> he
gives the country of the “Tchiglit” as extending from the Coppermine
River to the Colville, and on his map in the same volume, the
“Tareormeut” are laid down in the Mackenzie delta only. According to his
own account, however, he had no personal knowledge of any Eskimo west of
the Mackenzie delta. These people undoubtedly have a local name derived
from that of their winter village, but it is yet to be learned.</p>

<p>It is possible that they do consider themselves the same people with
the Eskimo of the Mackenzie delta, and call themselves by the general
name of “Taρèoρmeut” (= Taxaiomiun in the Point Barrow dialect), “those
who live by the sea.” That they do not call themselves “Kûñmû´dlĭñ” or
“Kanmali-enyuin” or “Kangmaligmeut” is to my mind quite certain. The
word “Kûñmû´dlĭñ,” as already stated, is used at Norton Sound to
designate the people of Point Barrow (I&nbsp;was called a “Kûñmû´dlĭñ”
by some Eskimo at St. Michaels because I spoke the Point Barrow
dialect), who do not recognize the name as belonging to themselves, but
have transferred it to the people under consideration. Now, “Kûñmû´dlĭñ”
is a word formed after the analogy of many Eskimo words from a noun
kûñme and the affix lĭñ or dlĭñ (in&nbsp;Greenlandic lik), “one who has
a &mdash;&mdash;.” The radical noun, the meaning of which I can not
ascertain, would become in the Mackenzie dialect kρagmaρk (using
Petitot’s orthography), which with <span class = "locked">-lik</span> in
the plural would make kρagmalit. (According to Petitot’s “Grammaire” the
plural of <span class = "locked">-lik</span> in the Mackenzie dialect is
<span class = "locked">-lit,</span> and not <span class =
"locked">-gdlit,</span> as in Greenlandic). This is the name given by
Petitot on his map to the people of the Anderson River,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag49" id = "tag49" href = "#note49">49</a> while he calls the
Anderson River itself Kρagmalik.<a class = "tag" name = "tag50" id =
"tag50" href = "#note50">50</a> The father, however, had but little
personal knowledge of the natives of the Anderson, having made but two,
apparently brief, visits to their village in 1865, when he first made
the acquaintance of the Eskimo. He afterwards became fairly intimate
with the Eskimo of the Mackenzie
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page47" id = "page47">
47</a></span>
delta, parties of whom spent the summers of 1869 and 1870 with him. From
these parties he appears to have obtained the greater part of the
information embodied in his Monographie and Vocabulaire, as he
explicitly states that he brought the last party to Fort Good Hope
“autant pour les instruire à loisir que pour apprendre d’eux leur
idiome.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag51" id = "tag51" href =
"#note51">51</a> Nothing seems to me more probable than that he learned
from these Mackenzie people the names of their neighbors of the
Anderson, which he had failed to obtain in his flying visits 5 years
before, and that it is the same name, “Kûñmû´dlĭñ,” which we have
followed from Norton Sound and found always applied to the people just
beyond us. Could we learn the meaning of this word the question might be
settled, but the only possible derivation I can see for it is from the
Greenlandic Karmaĸ, a&nbsp;wall, which throws no light upon the subject.
Petitot calls the people of Cape Bathurst Kρagmaliveit, which appears to
mean “the real Kûñmû´dlĭñ” (“Kûñmû´dlĭñ” and the affix <span class =
"locked">-vik,</span> “the real”).</p>

<p>The Kupûñmiun appear to inhabit the permanent villages which have
been seen near the western mouth of the Mackenzie, at Shingle Point<a
class = "tag" name = "tag52" id = "tag52" href = "#note52">52</a> and
Point Sabine,<a class = "tag" name = "tag53" id = "tag53" href =
"#note53">53</a> with an outlying village, supposed to be deserted, at
Point Kay.<a class = "tag" name = "tag54" id = "tag54" href =
"#note54">54</a> They are the natives described by Petitot in his
Monographie as the Taρèoρmeut division of the Tchiglit, to whom, from
the reasons already stated, most of his account seems to apply. There
appears to me no reasonable doubt, considering his opportunities for
observing these people, that Taρèoρmeut, “those who dwell by the sea,”
is the name that they actually apply to themselves, and that Kupûñmiun,
or Kopagmut, “those who live on the Great River,” is a name bestowed
upon them by their neighbors, perhaps their western neighbors alone,
since all the references to this name seem to be traceable to the
authority of Dr. Simpson. Should they apply to themselves a name of
similar meaning, it would probably be of a different form, as, according
to Petitot,<a class = "tag" name = "tag55" id = "tag55" href =
"#note55">55</a> they call the Mackenzie Kuρvik, instead of Kupûk or
Kupûñ.</p>

<p>These are the people who visit Fort Macpherson every spring and
summer,<a class = "tag" name = "tag56" id = "tag56" href =
"#note56">56</a> and are well known to the Hudson Bay traders as the
Mackenzie River Eskimo. They are the Eskimo encountered between Herschel
Island and the mouth of the Mackenzie by Franklin, by Dease and Simpson,
and by Hooper and Pullen, all of whom have published brief notes
concerning them.<a class = "tag" name = "tag57" id = "tag57" href =
"#note57">57</a></p>

<p>We are still somewhat at a loss for the proper local names of the
last
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page48" id = "page48">
48</a></span>
labret-wearing Eskimo, those, namely, of the Anderson River and Cape
Bathurst. That they are not considered by the Taρèoρmeut as belonging to
the same “tribe” with themselves is evident from the names Kρagmalit and
Kρagmalivëit, applied to them by Petitot. Sir John Richardson, the first
white man to encounter them (in&nbsp;1826), says that they called
themselves “Kitte-garrœ-oot,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag58" id =
"tag58" href = "#note58">58</a> and the Point Barrow people told Dr.
Simpson of country called “Kit-te-ga´-ru” beyond the Mackenzie.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag59" id = "tag59" href = "#note59">59</a> These
people, as well as the Taρèoρmeut, whom they closely resemble, are
described in Petitot’s Monographie, and brief notices of them are given
by Sir John Richardson,<a class = "tag" name = "tag60" id = "tag60" href
= "#note60">60</a> McClure,<a class = "tag" name = "tag61" id = "tag61"

"tag62" href = "#note62">62</a> and Hooper.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag63" id = "tag63" href = "#note63">63</a> The arts and industries of
these people from the Mackenzie to the Anderson, especially the latter
region, are well represented in the National Museum by the collections
of Messrs. Kennicott, Ross, and MacFarlane. The Point Barrow people say
that the Kupûñmiun are “bad;”<a class = "tag" name = "tag64" id =
"tag64" href = "#note64">64</a> but notwithstanding this small parties
from the two villages occasionally travel east to the Mackenzie, and
spend the winter at the Kupûñmiun village, whence they visit the “great
house,” returning the following season. Such a party left Point Barrow
June 15, 1882, declaring their intention of going all the way to the
Mackenzie. They returned August 25 or 26, 1883, when we were in the
midst of the confusion of closing the station, so that we learned no
details of their journey. A&nbsp;letter with which they were intrusted
to be forwarded to the United States through the Mackenzie River posts
reached the Chief Signal Officer in the summer of 1883 by way of the
Rampart House, on the Porcupine River, whence we received an answer by
the bearer from the factor in charge. The Eskimo probably sent the
letter to the Rampart House by the Indians who visit that post.</p>

<p>The intercourse between these people is purely commercial. Dr.
Simpson, in the paper so often quoted, gives an excellent detailed
description of the course of this trade, which agrees in the main with
our observations, though we did not learn the particulars of time and
distance as accurately as he did. There have been some important
changes, however, since his time. A&nbsp;small party, perhaps five or
six families, of “Nunatañmiun” now come every summer to Point Barrow
about the end of July, or as soon as the shallow bays along shore are
open. They establish themselves at the summer camping ground at Pérnyɐ,
at the southwest corner of Elson Bay, and stay two or three weeks,
trading with the natives and the ships, dancing, and shooting ducks. The
eastward-bound parties seem to start a little earlier than formerly
(July 7, 1853, July 3, 1854,<a class = "tag" name = "tag65" id = "tag65"
href = "#note65">65</a> June 18, 1882, and June 29, 1883). From all
accounts their relations
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page49" id = "page49">
49</a></span>
with the eastern people are now perfectly friendly. We heard nothing of
the precautionary measures described by Dr. Simpson,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag66" id = "tag66" href = "#note66">66</a> and the women talked
frequently of their trading with the Kûñmû´dlĭñ and even with the
Kupûñmiun.<a class = "tag" name = "tag67" id = "tag67" href =
"#note67">67</a> We did not learn definitely whether they met the latter
at Barter Point or whether they went still farther east.</p>

<p>Some of the Point Barrow parties do not go east of the Colville. The
articles of trade have changed somewhat in the last 30 years, from the
fact that the western natives can now buy directly from the whalers iron
articles, arms, and ammunition, beads, tobacco, etc. The Nunatañmiun now
sell chiefly furs, deerskins, and clothing ready made from them,
woodenware (buckets and tubs), willow poles for setting nets, and
sometimes fossil ivory. The double-edged Siberian knives are no longer
in the market and appear to be going out of fashion, though a few of
them are still in use. Ready-made stone articles, like the whetstones
mentioned by Dr. Simpson,<a class = "tag" name = "tag68" id = "tag68"
href = "#note68">68</a> are rarely, if ever, in the market. We did not
hear of the purchase of stone lamps from the eastern natives. This is
probably due to a cessation of the demand for them at Point Barrow,
owing to the falling off in the population.</p>

<p>The Kûñmû´dlĭñ no longer furnish guns and ammunition, as the western
natives prefer the breech-loading arms they obtain from the whalers to
the flintlock guns sold by the Hudson Bay Company. The trade with these
people seems to be almost entirely for furs and skins, notably black and
red fox skins and wolverine skins. Skins of the narwhal or beluga are no
longer mentioned as important articles of trade.</p>

<p>In return for these things the western natives give sealskins, etc.,
especially oil, as formerly, though I believe that very little, if any,
whalebone is now carried east, since the natives prefer to save it for
trading with the ships in the hope of getting liquor, or arms and
ammunition, and various articles of American manufacture, beads,
kettles, etc. I&nbsp;was told by an intelligent native of Utkiavwĭñ that
brass kettles were highly prized by the Kupûñmiun, and that a large one
would bring three wolverine skins,<a class = "tag" name = "tag69" id =
"tag69" href = "#note69">69</a> three black foxskins, or five red ones.
One woman was anxious to get all the empty tin cans she could, saying
that she could sell them to the Kûñmû´dlĭñ for a foxskin apiece. We were
told that the eastern natives were glad to buy gun flints and
bright-colored handkerchiefs, and that the Nunatañmiun wanted blankets
and playing cards.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "people_social_indian" id =
"people_social_indian" href = "#people_social">Indians.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>They informed us that east of the Colville they sometimes met
“Itkû´dlĭñ,” people with whom they could not converse, but who were
friendly and traded with them, buying oil for fox skins. They were said
to live back of the coast between the Colville and the Mackenzie, and
were described as wearing no labrets, but rings in their ears and noses.
They wear their hair long, do not tonsure the crown, and are dressed in
jackets of skin with the hair removed, without hoods, and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page50" id = "page50">
50</a></span>
ornamented with beads and fringe. We saw one or two such jackets in
Utkiavwĭñ apparently made of moose skin, and a few pouches of the same
material, highly ornamented with beads. They have long flintlock guns,
white man’s wooden pipes, which they value highly, and axes&mdash;not
adzes&mdash;with which they “break many trees.” We easily understood
from this description that Indians were meant, and since our return I
have been able to identify one or two of the tribes with tolerable
certainty.</p>

<p>They seem better acquainted with these people than in Dr. Simpson’s
time, and know the word “kŭtchin,” people, in which many of the tribal
names end. We did not hear the names Ko´yukan or Itkalya´ruin which Dr.
Simpson learned, apparently from the Nunatañmiun.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag70" id = "tag70" href = "#note70">70</a> I&nbsp;heard one man speak
of the Kŭtcha Kutchin, who inhabit the “Yukon from the Birch River to
the Kotlo River on the east and the Porcupine River on the north,
ascending the latter a short distance.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag71"
id = "tag71" href = "#note71">71</a></p>

<p>One of the tribes with which they have dealings is the “Rat Indians”
of the Hudson Bay men, probably the Vunta´-Kŭtchin,<a class = "tag" name
= "tag72" id = "tag72" href = "#note72">72</a> from the fact that they
visit Fort Yukon. These are the people whom Capt. Maguire met on his
unsuccessful sledge journey to the eastward to communicate with
Collinson. The Point Barrow people told us that “Magwa” went east to see
“Colli´k-sina,” but did not see him, only saw the Itkûdlĭñ. Collinson,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag73" id = "tag73" href = "#note73">73</a>
speaking of Maguire’s second winter at Point Barrow, says: “In
attempting to prosecute the search easterly, an armed body of Indians of
the Koyukun tribe were met with, and were so hostile that he was
compelled to return.” Maguire himself, in his official report,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag74" id = "tag74" href = "#note74">74</a> speaks of
meeting <i>four</i> Indians who had followed his party for several days.
He says nothing of any hostile demonstration; in fact, says they showed
signs of disappointment at his having nothing to trade with them, but
his Eskimo, he says, called them Koyukun, which he knew was the tribe
that had so barbarously murdered Lieut. Barnard at Nulato in 1851.
Moreover, each Indian had a musket, and he had only two with a party of
eight men, so he thought it safer to turn back. However, he seems to
have distributed among them printed “information slips,” which they
immediately carried to Fort Yukon, and returning to the coast with a
letter from the clerk in charge, delivered it to Capt. Collinson on
board of the <i>Enterprise</i> at Barter Island, July 18, 1854. The
letter is as follows:</p>

<div class = "letter">
<p class = "right">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fort Youcon</span>, <i>June 27, 1854</i>.</p>

<p>The printed slips of paper delivered by the officers of H.M.S.
<i>Plover</i> on the 25th of April, 1854, to the Rat Indians were
received on the 27th of June, 1854, at the Hudson Bay Company’s
establishment, Fort Youcon. The Rat Indians are in the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page51" id = "page51">
51</a></span>
habit of making periodical trading excursions to the Esquimaux along the
coast. They are a harmless, inoffensive set of Indians, ever ready and
willing to render any assistance they can to the whites.</p>

<i>Clerk in charge</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tag75" id = "tag75" href

</div>

<p>Capt. Collinson evidently never dreamed of identifying this
“harmless, inoffensive set of Indians” with “an armed body of Indians of
the Koyukun tribe.” It is important that his statement, quoted above,
should be corrected lest it serve as authority for extending the range
of the Koyukun Indians<a class = "tag" name = "tag76" id = "tag76" href
= "#note76">76</a> to the Arctic Ocean. The Point Barrow people also
know the name of the U´na-kho-tānā,<a class = "tag" name = "tag77" id =
"tag77" href = "#note77">77</a> or En´akotina, as they pronounce it.
Their intercourse with all these Indians appears to be rather slight and
purely commercial. Friendly relations existed between the Rat Indians
and the “Eskimos who live somewhere near the Colville” as early as
1849,<a class = "tag" name = "tag78" id = "tag78" href =
"#note78">78</a> while it was still “war to the knife” between the Peel
River Indians and the Kupûñmiun.<a class = "tag" name = "tag79" id =
"tag79" href = "#note79">79</a></p>

<p>The name Itkû´dlĭñ, of which I´t-ka-lyi of Dr. Simpson appears to be
the plural, is a generic word for an Indian, and is undoubtedly the same
as the Greenland word erĸileĸ&mdash;plural erĸigdlit&mdash;which means a
fabulous “inlander” with a face like a dog. “They are martial spirits
and inhuman foes to mankind; however, they only inhabit the east side of
the land.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag80" id = "tag80" href =
"#note80">80</a> Dr. Rink<a class = "tag" name = "tag81" id = "tag81"
href = "#note81">81</a> has already pointed out that this name is in use
as far as the Mackenzie River&mdash;for instance, the Indians are called
“eert-kai-lee” (Parry), or “it-kagh-lie” (Lyon), at Fury and Hecla
Strait; ik-kil-lin (Gilder), at the west shore of Hudson Bay, and
“itkρe´le´it” (Petitot) at the Mackenzie. Petitot also gives this word
as <ins class = "correction" title =
"printed as shown: expected ρ (rho)for ‘p’">itkpe´lit</ins> in his vocabulary (p.&nbsp;<ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘42.)’">42).</ins> These words, including
the term Ingalik, or In-ka-lik, applied by the natives of Norton Sound
to the Indians,<a class = "tag" name = "tag82" id = "tag82" href =
"#note82">82</a> and which Mr. Dall was informed meant “children of a
louse’s egg,” all appear to be compounds of the word erĸeĸ, a&nbsp;louse
egg, and the affix lik. (I&nbsp;suspect erĸileĸ, from the form of its
plural, to be a corruption of “erĸiliĸ,” since there is no recognized
affix <span class = "locked">-leĸ</span> in Greenlandic.)</p>

<p>Petitot<a class = "tag" name = "tag83" id = "tag83" href =
"#note83">83</a> gives an interesting tradition in regard to the origin
of this name: “La tradition Innok dédaigne de parler ici des

<p>Until the visit of the <i>Blossom’s</i> barge in 1826 these people
had never seen a white man, although they were already in possession of
tobacco and articles of Russian manufacture, such as copper kettles,
which they
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page52" id = "page52">
52</a></span>
had obtained from Siberia by way of the Diomedes. Mr. Elson’s party
landed only at Refuge Inlet, and had but little intercourse with the
natives. His visit seemed to have been forgotten by the time of the
<i>Plover’s</i> stay at Point Barrow, though Dr. Simpson found people
who recollected the visit of Thomas Simpson in 1837.<a class = "tag"

had left the boats and was proceeding on foot with his party, first met
the Nuwŭñmiun at Point Tangent, where there was a small party encamped,
from whom he purchased the umiak in which he went on to Point Barrow. He
landed there early in the morning of August 4, and went down to the
summer camp at Pernyɐ, where he stayed till 1 o’clock in the afternoon,
trading with the natives and watching them dance. On his return to Point
Tangent some of the natives accompanied him to Boat Extreme, where he
parted from them August 6, so that his whole intercourse with them was
confined to less than a week.<a class = "tag" name = "tag85" id =

<p>The next white men who landed at Point Barrow were the party in the

the Mackenzie, and the crew of Mr. Sheddon’s yacht, the <i>Nancy
Dawson</i>, in the summer of 1849. The boats were from July 29 to August
3 getting from Cape Smyth past Point Barrow, when the crews were ashore
for a couple of days and did a little trading with the natives, whom
they found very friendly. They afterwards had one or two skirmishes with
evil-disposed parties of Nuwŭñmiun returning from the east in the
neighborhood of Return Reef. The exploring ships <i>Enterprise</i> and
<i>Investigator</i> also had casual meetings with the natives, who
received tobacco, etc., from the ships.</p>

<p>The depot ship <i>Plover</i>, Commander Maguire, spent the winters of
1852-’53 and 1853-’54 at Point Barrow, and the officers and crew, after
some misunderstandings and skirmishes, established very friendly and
sociable relations with the natives. The only published accounts of the
<i>Plover’s</i> stay at Point Barrow are Commander Maguire’s official
reports, published in the Parliamentary Reports (Blue Books) for 1854,
pp. 165-185, and 1855, pp. 905 et seq., and Dr. Simpson’s paper, already
mentioned. Maguire’s report of the first winter’s proceedings is also
published as an appendix to Sherard Osborne’s “Discovery of the
Northwest Passage.”</p>

<p>We found that the elder natives remembered Maguire, whom they called
“Magwa,” very well. They gave us the names of many of his people and a
very correct account of the most important proceedings, though they did
not make it clear that the death of the man mentioned in his report was
accidental. They described “Magwa” as short and fat, with a very thick
neck, and all seemed very much impressed with the height of his first
lieutenant, “Epi´ana” <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads‘(Vernon,)’">(<i>Vernon</i>),</ins> who had “lots of guns.”</p>

<p>It was difficult to see that the <i>Plover’s</i> visit had exerted
any permanent influence on these people. In fact, Dr. Simpson’s account
of their habits and customs would serve very well for the present time,
except
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page53" id = "page53">
53</a></span>
in regard to the use of firearms. They certainly remembered no English.
Indeed, Dr. Simpson says<a class = "tag" name = "tag86" id = "tag86"
href = "#note86">86</a> that they learned hardly any. The
<i>Plover’s</i> people probably found it very easy to do as we did and
adopt a sort of jargon of Eskimo words and “pigeon English” grammar for
general intercourse. Although, according to the account of the natives,
there was considerable intercourse between the sailors and the Eskimo
women, there are now no people living at either village who we could be
sure were born from such intercourse, though one woman was suspected of
being half English. She was remarkable only for her large build, and was
not lighter than many pure-blooded women.</p>

<p>Since 1854, when the first whalers came as far north as the Point,
there has hardly been a season in which ships have not visited this
region, and for a couple of months every year the natives have had
considerable intercourse with the whites, going off to the ships to
trade, while the sailors come ashore occasionally. We found that they
usually spoke of white men as “kablu´na;” but they informed us that they
had another word, “tû´n-nyĭn,” which they used to employ among
themselves when they saw a ship. Dr. Simpson<a class = "tag" name =
"tag87" id = "tag87" href = "#note87">87</a> says that they learned the
word “kabluna” from the eastern natives, but that the latter
(he&nbsp;gives it Tan´-ning or Tan´-gin) came from the Nunata´ñmiun. He
supposes it to apply to the Russians, who had regular bath days at their
posts, and says it is derived from tan-nikh-lu-go, to wash or cleanse
the person.</p>

<p>The chief change resulting from their intercourse with the whites has
been the introduction of firearms. Nearly all the natives are now
provided with guns, some of them of the best modern patterns of
breechloaders, and they usually succeed in procuring a supply of
ammunition. This is in some respects a disadvantage, as the reindeer
have become so wild that the natives would no longer be able to procure
a sufficient number of them for food and clothing with their former
appliances, and they are thus rendered dependent on the ships. On the
other hand, with a plentiful supply of ammunition it is easier for them
to procure abundance of food, both deer and seals, and they are less
liable to famine than in former times.</p>

<p>There is no reason to fear, as has been suggested, that they will
lose the art of making any of their own weapons except in the case of
the bow. With firearms alone they would be unable to obtain any seals,
a&nbsp;much more important source of food than the reindeer, and their
own appliances for sealing are much better than any civilized
contrivances. Although they have plenty of the most improved modern
whaling gear, they are not likely to forget the manufacture of their own
implements for this purpose, as this important fishery is ruled by
tradition and superstition, which insists that at least one harpoon of
the ancient pattern must be used in taking every whale. All are now rich
in iron, civilized tools, canvas and wreck wood, and in this respect
their condition is improved.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page54" id = "page54">
54</a></span>
<p>They have, however, adopted very few civilized habits. They have
contracted a taste for civilized food, especially hard bread and flour,
but this they are unable to obtain for 10 months of the year, and they
are thus obliged to adhere to their former habits. In fact, except in
regard to the use of firearms and mechanics’ tools, they struck me as
essentially a conservative people.</p>

<p>Petroff<a class = "tag" name = "tag88" id = "tag88" href =
"#note88">88</a> makes the assertion that in late years their movements
have been guided chiefly by those of the whalers. As far as we could
observe they have not changed the course or time of their journeys since
Dr. Simpson’s time, except that they have given up the autumn whaling,
possibly on account of the presence of the ships at that season. Of
course, men who are rich in whalebone now stay to trade with the ships,
while those who have plenty of oil go east. They are not absolutely
dependent on the ships for anything except ammunition, and even during
the short time the ships are with them they hardly neglect their own
pursuits.</p>

<p>The one unmitigated evil of their intercourse with the whites has
been the introduction of spirits. Apart from the direct injury which
liquor does to their health, their passionate fondness for it leads them
to barter away valuable articles which should have served to procure
ammunition or other things of permanent use. It is to be hoped, however,
that the liquor traffic is decreasing. The vigilance of the revenue
cutter prevents regular whisky traders from reaching the Arctic Ocean,
and public opinion among the whaling captains seems to be growing in the
right direction.</p>

<p>Another serious evil, which it would be almost impossible to check,
is the unlimited intercourse of the sailors with the Eskimo women. The
whites can hardly be said to have introduced laxity of sexual morals,
but they have encouraged a natural savage tendency, and have taught them
prostitution for gain, which has brought about great excesses,
fortunately confined to a short season. This may have something to do
with the want of fertility among the women.</p>

<p>Our two years of friendly relations with these people were greatly to
their advantage. Not only were our house and our doings a constant
source of amusement to them, but they learned to respect and trust the
whites. Without becoming dependent on us or receiving any favors without
some adequate return either in work or goods, they were able to obtain
tobacco, hard bread, and many other things of use to them, all through
the year. Our presence prevented their procuring more than trifling
quantities of spirits, and though the supply of breech-loading
ammunition was pretty well cut off, they could get plenty of powder and
shot for their muzzle loaders. The abundance of civilized food was
undoubtedly good for them, and our surgeon was able to give them a great
deal of help in sickness.</p>

<p>In all their intercourse with the whites they have learned very
little
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page55" id = "page55">
55</a></span>
English, chiefly a few oaths and exclamations like “Get out of here,”
and the words of such songs as “Little Brown Jug” and “Shoo Fly,”
curiously distorted. They have as a rule invented genuine Eskimo words
for civilized articles which are new to them.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag89" id = "tag89" href = "#note89">89</a> Even in their intimate
relations with us they learned but few more phrases and in most cases
without a knowledge of their meaning.</p>

<p>There are a few Hawaiian words introduced by the Kanaka sailors on
the whaleships, which are universally employed between whites and Eskimo
along the whole of the Arctic coast, and occasionally at least among the
Eskimo themselves. These are <i>kau-kau</i>,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag90" id = "tag90" href = "#note90">90</a> food, or to eat;
<i>hana-hana</i>, work; <i>pûnĭ-pûnĭ</i>, <i>coitus</i>, and <i>pau</i>,
not. <i>Wahíne</i>, woman, is also used, but is less common. Another
foreign word now universally employed among them in their intercourse
with the whites, and even, I&nbsp;believe, among themselves, is “kuníɐ”
for woman or wife. They themselves told us that it was not an Eskimo
word&mdash;“When there were no white men, there was no
<i>kuníɐ</i>”&mdash;and some of the whalemen who had been at Hudson Bay
said it was the “Greenland” word for woman. It was not until our return
to this country that we discovered it to be the Danish word <i>kone</i>,
woman, which in the corrupted form “coony” is in common use among the
eastern Eskimo generally in the jargon they employ in dealing with the
whites. <i>Kuníɐ</i> is “coony” with the suffix of the third person, and
therefore means “his wife.” It is sometimes used at Point Barrow for
either of a married couple in the sense of our word “spouse.”</p>

<p>The wolf, <ins class = "correction" title =
"printed as shown, butmay be meant for ‘amáχo’ (chi for x)">amáxo</ins> (Canis lupus
griseo-albus), is not uncommon in the interior, but rarely if ever
reaches the coast. Red and black foxes, kaiă´ktûk (Vulpes fulvus fulvus
and argentatus), are chiefly known from their skins, which are common
articles in the trade with the eastern natives, and the same is true of
the wolverine, ka´vwĭñ (Gulo luscus), and the marten, kabweatyía
(Mustela americana). The arctic fox, tĕrĭgûniɐ (Vulpes lagopus), is very
abundant along the coast, while the ermine (Putorius erminea) and
Parry’s spermophile (Spermophilus empetra empetra) are not rare. The
last is called sĭksĭñ. Lemmings, a´vwĭñɐ, of two species (Cuniculus
torquatus and Myodes obensis) are
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page56" id = "page56">
56</a></span>
very abundant some years, and they recognize a tiny shrewmouse (Sorex
forsteri). This little animal is called ugrúnɐ, a&nbsp;word
corresponding to the name ugssungnaĸ given to the same animal in
Labrador, which, according to Kleinschmidt,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag91" id = "tag91" href = "#note91">91</a> is an ironical application
of the name of the largest seal, ugssuk (ugru at Point Barrow), to the
smallest mammal known to the Eskimo. The same name is also applied at
Point Barrow to the fossil ox, whose bones are sometimes found. The most
abundant land animal, however, is the reindeer, tŭ´ktu (Rangifer
tarandus grœnlandicus), which is found in winter in great herds along
the upper waters of the rivers, occasionally coming down to the coast,
and affords a very important supply of food.</p>

<p>The moose, tŭ´ktuwŭñ, or “big reindeer” (Alce machlis), is well known
from the accounts of the Nunatañmiun, who bring moose skins to trade.
Some of the natives have been east to hunt the mountain sheep, i´mnêɐ
(Ovis canadensis dalli), and all are familiar with its skin, horns, and
teeth, which they buy of the eastern natives. The musk ox, umĭñmau
(Ovibos moschatus), is known only from its bones, which are sometimes
found on the tundra. Inland, near the rivers, they also find a large
brown bear, ă´kqlak, which is probably the barren ground bear, while on
the ice-pack, the polar bear, nä´nu (Thalassarctos maritimus), is not
uncommon, sometimes making raids on the provision storehouses in the
villages.</p>

<p>The most important sea animal is the little rough seal, nĕtyĭĸ (Phoca
fœtida), which is very abundant at all seasons. Its flesh is the great
staple of food, while its blubber supplies the Eskimo lamps, and its
skin serves countless useful purposes. The great bearded seal, úgru
(Erignathus barbatus), is less common. It is especially valued for its
hide, which serves for covering the large boats and making stout harpoon
lines. Two other species of seal, the harbor seal, kasigía (Phoca
vitulina), and the beautiful ribbon seal, kaixólĭñ (Phoca fasciata), are
known, but both are uncommon, the latter very rare.</p>

<p>Herds of walrus, ai´bwêk (Odobænus obesus), pass along the coast in
the open season, generally resting on cakes of floating ice, and are
pursued for their hides and ivory as well as their flesh and blubber.
Whales, akbwêk, of the species Balæna mysticetus, most pursued for its
oil and whalebone, travel along the coast in the leads of open water
above described from the middle of April to the latter part of June in
large numbers, and return in the autumn, appearing about the end of
August. White whales, kĭlĕlua (Delphinapterus&nbsp;sp.), are not
uncommon in the summer, and they say the narwhal, tugálĭñ (Monodon
monoceros), is occasionally seen. They are also acquainted with another
cetacean, which they call áxlo, and which appears from their description
to be a species of Orca.</p>

<p>In the spring, that is during May and the early part of June, vast
flocks of migrating ducks pass to the northeast, close to the shore,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page57" id = "page57">
57</a></span>
a few only remaining to breed, and return at the end of the summer from
the latter part of July to the end of September. Nearly all the
returning birds cross the isthmus of Point Barrow at Pernyɐ where the
natives assemble in large numbers for the purpose of taking them. These
migrating birds are mostly king ducks, kĭñalĭñ (Somateria spectabilis),
Pacific eiders, amau´lĭñ (S.&nbsp;v-nigra), and long-tailed ducks,
a´dyigi´a, a´hadlĭñ (Clangula hyemalis), with smaller numbers of the
spectacled eider, ka´waso (Arctonetta fischeri), and Steller’s ducks,
ĭgnikau´kto (Eniconetta stelleri). At the rivers they also find numbers
of pintails, i´vwûgɐ (Dafila acuta), which visit the coast in small
numbers during the migrations. Geese of three species, the American
white-fronted goose, nû´glûgruɐ (Anser albifrons gambeli), the lesser
snow-goose, kû´ño (Chen hyperborea), and the black brant, nûglû´gnɐ
(Branta nigricans), are not uncommon on the coast both during the
migrations and the breeding season, but the natives find them in much
greater abundance at the rivers, where they also find a species of swan,
ku´gru, probably Olor columbianus, which rarely visits the coast.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the natives are the gulls, of which the Point
Barrow gull, nau´yɐ (Larus barrovianus), is the most abundant all
through the season, though the rare rosy gull, kă´ñmaxlu (Rhodostethes
rosea), appears in multitudes late in the autumn. The ivory gull (Gavia
alba), nariyalbwûñ, and Sabine’s gull, yûkû´drĭgûgi´ɐ (Xema Sabinii),
are uncommon, while the Arctic tern, utyuta´kĭn (Sterna paradisea), is
rather abundant, especially about the sandspits of Nuwŭk. All these
species, particularly the larger ones, are taken for food.</p>

<p>Three species of loons are common: the great white-billed loon,
tu´dlĭñ (Urinator adamsi), and the Pacific and red-throated divers
(U.&nbsp;pacificus and lumme), which are not distinguished from each
other but are both called kă´ksau. They also occasionally see the
thick-billed guillemot a´kpa (Uria lomvia arra), and more often the
sea-pigeon, sêkbwɐk (Cephus mandtii). The three species of jaegers
(Stercorarius pomarinus, parasiticus, and longicaudus) are not
distinguished from one another but are all called isuñɐ. They pay but
little attention to the numerous species of wading birds which appear in
considerable abundance in the migrations and breeding season, but they
recognize among them the turnstone, tûlĭ´gwa (Arenaria interpres), the
gray plover, ki´raio´n (Charadrius squatarola), the American golden
plover, tu´dlĭñ (C.&nbsp;dominicus), the knot, tu´awi´a (Tringa
canutus), the pectoral and Baird’s sandpipers, (T.&nbsp;maculata and
bairdii), both called ai´bwûkiɐ, the red-backed sandpiper mêkapĭñ
(T.&nbsp;alpina pacifica), the semipalmated sandpiper, nĭwĭlĭwĭ´lûk
(Ereunetes pusillus), the buff-breasted sandpiper, nu´dluayu (Tryngites
subruficollis), the red phalarope, sabrañ (Chrymophilus fulicarius), and
the northern phalarope, sabrañnɐ; (Phalaropus lobatus). The last is rare
at Point Barrow, but they see many of them near the Colville. The little
brown crane, tutĭ´drĭgɐ (Grus canadensis), is also rare at the Point,
but they say they find many of them at the mouth of Kulu´grua.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page58" id = "page58">
58</a></span>
<p>Of land birds, the most familiar are the little snow bunting,
amauligɐ (Plectrophenax nivalis), the first bird to arrive in the
spring, the Lapland longspur, nĕssau´dligɐ (Calcarius lapponicus), and
two species of grouse, the willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus) and the rock
ptarmigan (L.&nbsp;rupestris), which are both called akû´dĭgĭn. These
two birds do not migrate, but are to be seen all winter, as is also the
well known snowy owl, u´kpĭk (Nyctea nyctea). A&nbsp;gerfalcon,
kĭ´drĭgûmĭñ (Falco rusticolus), is also sometimes seen, and skins and
feathers of the golden eagle, tĭ´ñmiɐkpûk, “the great bird” (Aquila
chrysætos), are brought from the east for charms and ornaments. The
raven, tulúɐ (Corvus corax sinuatus), was not seen at Point Barrow, but
the natives are familiar with it and have many of its skins for amulets.
Several species of small land birds also occur in small numbers, but the
natives are not familiar with them and call them all “sû´ksaxíɐ.” This
name appears to mean “wanderer” or “flutterer,” and probably belongs,
I&nbsp;believe, to the different species of redpolls (Aegiothus).</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "natural_animals_fishes" id =

"#natural_animals">Fishes.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>A few species only of fish are found in the salt water. Of these the
most abundant are the little polar cod (Boreogadus saida), which is
plentiful through the greater part of the year, and is often an
important source of food, and the capelin, añmû´grûñ (Mallotus
villosus), which is found in large schools close to the beach in the
middle of summer. There are also caught sometimes two species of
sculpins, kû´naio (Cottus quadricornis and decastrensis), and two
species of Lycodes, kúgraunɐ (L.&nbsp;turnerii and coccineus). In the
gill nets at Elson Bay they also catch two species of salmon
(Onchorhynchus gorbuscha and nerka) and a whitefish (Coregonus laurettæ)
in small numbers, and occasionally a large trout (Salvelinus malma). The
last-named fish they find sometimes in great numbers, near the mouth of
the Colville.</p>

<p>The greatest quantities of fish are taken in the rivers, especially
Kuaru and Kulugrua, by fishing through the ice in the winter. They say
there are no fish taken in Ikpikpûñ, and account for this by explaining
that the former two rivers freeze down to the bottom on the shallow bars
inclosing deep pools in which the fish are held, while in the latter the
ice never touches the bottom, so that the fish are free to run down to
the sea. The species caught are the small Coregonus laurettæ, two large
whitefish (C.&nbsp;kennicottii and nelsoni), and the burbot, tita´liñ
(Lota maculosa). They speak of a fish, sulukpau´ga (which appears to
mean “wing-fin” and is applied in Greenland to a species of Sebastes),
that is caught with the hook in Kulugrua apparently only in summer, and
seems from the description to be Back’s grayling (Thymallus signifer).
In the river Ku is caught a smelt, ĭthoa´nĭñ (Osmerus dentex). In the
great lake, Tă´syûkpûñ (see above, <a href = "#page29">p.&nbsp;29</a>),
they tell of an enormous fish “as big as a kaiak.” They gave it no name,
but describe it as having a red belly and white flesh. One man said he
had seen one 18 feet long, but another was more moderate, giving about 3
feet as the length of the longest he had seen.</p>

<p>Of insects, they recognize the troublesome mosquito, kiktorɐ (Culex

they seem much afraid of, and call i´gutyai, and the universal louse,
ku´mɐk. All the large winged insects, including the rare butterflies and
moths and crane flies, are called tûkĭlû´kica, or tûkilûkĭdja´ksûn,
which is also the name of the yellow poppy (Papaver nudicaule). We were
told that “by and by” the poppies would turn into “little birds” and fly
away, which led us to suppose that there was some yellow butterfly which
we should find abundant in the later summer, but we saw none either
season. A&nbsp;small spider is sometimes found in the Eskimo houses, and
is called pidrairu´rɐ, “the little braider.” They pay but little
attention to other invertebrates, but are familiar with worms, kupidro,
a&nbsp;species of crab, kinau´rɐ, (Hyas latifrons), and the little
branchipus, iritu´ña (Greenlandic issitôrak, “the little one with big
eyes”), of the fresh water-pools. Cockles (Buccinum, etc.) are called
siu´tigo (Gr.&nbsp;siuterok, from siut, ear), and clams have a name

<h4><a name = "natural_plants" id = "natural_plants" href =

<p>Few plants that are of any service to man grow in this region. The
willows, ŭ´kpĭk, of various species, which near the coast are nothing
but creeping vines, are sometimes used as fuel, especially along the
rivers, where they grow into shrubs 5 or 6 feet high. Their catkins are
used for tinder and the moss, mû´nĭk, furnishes wicks for the lamps. We
could find no fruit that could be eaten. A&nbsp;cranberry (Vaccinium
vitis-idæa) occurs, but produced no fruit either season. No use is made
of the different species of grass, which are especially luxuriant around
the houses at Utkiavwĭñ, where the ground is richly manured with various
sorts of refuse,<a class = "tag" name = "tag92" id = "tag92" href =
"#note92">92</a> though the species of mosses and lichens furnish the
reindeer with food easily reached in the winter through the light
covering of snow. Little attention is paid to the numerous, and
sometimes showy, flowering plants. We learned but two names of flowers,
the one mentioned above, tûkĭlû´kica, tûkĭlûkĭdja´ksûn, which seemed to
be applied to all striking yellow or white flowers, such as Papaver,
Ranunculus, and Draba, and mai´sun, the bright pink Pedicularis. All the
wood used in this region, except the ready-made woodenware and the
willow poles obtained from the Nunatañmiun, comes from the drift on the
beach. Most of this on the beach west of Point Barrow appears to come
from the southwest, as the prevailing current along this shore is to the
northeast, and may be derived from the large rivers flowing into
Kotzebue Sound, since it shows signs of having been long in the water.
The driftwood, which is reported to be abundant east of Point Barrow,
probably comes from the great rivers emptying into the Arctic
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page60" id = "page60">
60</a></span>
Ocean. This wood is sufficiently abundant to furnish the natives with
all they need for fuel and other purposes, and consists chiefly of pine,
spruce, and cottonwood, mostly in the form of water-worn logs, often of
large size. Of late years, also, much wood of the different kinds used
in shipbuilding has drifted ashore from wrecks.</p>


<h4><a name = "natural_minerals" id = "natural_minerals" href =
"#natural">MINERALS.</a></h4>

<p>The people of this region are acquainted with few mineral substances,
excluding the metals which they obtain from the whites. The most
important are flint, slate, soapstone, jade, and a peculiar form of
massive pectolite, first described by Prof. F.&nbsp;W. Clarke<a class =
"tag" name = "tag93" id = "tag93" href = "#note93">93</a> from specimens
brought home by our party. Flint, ánma, was formerly in great demand for
arrow and spear heads and other implements, and according to Dr.
Simpson<a class = "tag" name = "tag94" id = "tag94" href =
"#note94">94</a> was obtained from the Nunatañmiun. It is generally
black or a slightly translucent gray, but we collected a number of
arrowheads, etc., made of jasper, red or variegated. A&nbsp;few crystals
of transparent quartz, sometimes smoky, were also seen, and appeared to
be used as amulets. Slate, ulu´ksɐ, “material for a round knife,” was
used, as its name imports, for making the woman’s round knife, and for
harpoon blades, etc. It is a smooth clay slate, varying in hardness, and
light green, red, purple, dark gray, or black in color. All the pieces
of soft gray soapstone, tună´ktɐ, which are so common at both villages,
are probably fragments of the lamps and kettles obtained in former years
from the eastern natives. The jade is often very beautiful, varying from
a pale or bright translucent green to a dark olive, almost black, and
was formerly used for making adzes, whetstones, and occasionally other
implements. The pectolite, generally of a pale greenish or bluish color,
was only found in the form of oblong, more or less cylindrical masses,
used as hammerheads. Both of these minerals were called kau´dlo, and
were said to come “from the east, a&nbsp;long way off,” from high rocky
ground, but all that we could learn was very indefinite. Dr. Simpson was

the Kuwûk River, so that this jade is probably the same as that which is
said to form Jade Mountain, in that region.</p>

<p>Bits of porphyry, syenite, and similar rocks are used for making
labrets, and large pebbles are used as hammers and net sinkers. They
have also a little iron pyrites, both massive and in the form of
spherical concretions. The latter were said to come from the mouth of
the Colville, and are believed by the natives to have fallen from the
sky. Two other kinds of stone are brought from the neighborhood of
Nu´ɐsŭknan, partly, it appears, as curiosities, and partly with some ill
defined mystical notions. The first are botryoidal masses of brown
limonite, resembling bog iron ore, and the other sort curious
concretions, looking like the familiar “clay stones,” but very heavy,
and apparently containing a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page61" id = "page61">

great deal of iron pyrites. White gypsum, used for rubbing the flesh
side of deerskins, is obtained on the seashore at a place called Tû´tyĕ,
“one sleep” east from Point Barrow.</p>

<p>Bituminous coal, alu´a, is well known, though not used for fuel. Many
small fragments, which come perhaps from the vein at Cape Beaufort,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag96" id = "tag96" href = "#note96">96</a> are
picked up on the beach. Shaly, very bituminous coal, broken into small
square fragments, is rather abundant on the bars of Kulugrua, whence
specimens were brought by Capt. Herendeen. A&nbsp;native of Wainwright
Inlet gave us to understand that coal existed in a regular vein near
that place, and told a story of a burning hill in that region. This may
be a coal bed on fire, or possibly “smoking cliffs,” like those seen by
the <i>Investigator</i> in Franklin Bay.<a class = "tag" name = "tag97"
id = "tag97" href = "#note97">97</a> We also heard a story of a lake of
tar or bitumen, ádngun, said to be situated on an island a day’s sail
east of the point. Blacklead, mĭ´ñun, and red ocher are abundant and
used as pigments, but we did not learn where they were obtained. Pieces
of amber are sometimes found on the beach and are carried as amulets or
(rarely) made into beads. Amber is called aúmɐ, a&nbsp;word that in
other Eskimo dialects, and probably in this also, means “a&nbsp;live
coal.” Its application to a lump of amber is quite a striking figure of
speech.</p>

<p>The food of these people consists almost entirely of animal
substances. The staple article of food is the flesh of the rough seal,
of which they obtain more than of any other meat. Next in importance is
the venison of the reindeer, though this is looked upon as a kind of
dainty.<a class = "tag" name = "tag98" id = "tag98" href =
"#note98">98</a> Many well developed fœtal reindeer are brought home
from the spring deer hunt and are said to be excellent eating, though we
never saw them eaten. They also eat the flesh of the other three species
of seal, the walrus, the polar bear, the “bowhead” whale, the white
whale, and all the larger kinds of birds, geese, ducks, gulls, and
grouse. All the different kinds of fish appear to be eaten, with the
possible exception of the two species of Lycodes (only a few of these
were caught, and all were purchased for our collection) and very little
of a fish is wasted except the hardest parts. Walrus hide is sometimes
cooked and eaten in times of scarcity. Mollusks of any kind are rarely
eaten, as it is difficult to procure them. After a heavy gale in the
autumn of 1881, when the beach was covered with marine animals, mostly
lamellibranch mollusks with their shells and softer parts broken off by
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page62" id = "page62">
62</a></span>
the violence of the surf, we saw one woman collect a lapful of these
“clam-heads,” which she said she was going to eat. The “blackskin”
(epidermis) of the whale is considered a great delicacy by them, as by
all the other Eskimo who are able to procure it, and they are also very
fond of the tough white skin or gum round the roots of the whalebone.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag99" id = "tag99" href = "#note99">99</a></p>

<p>We saw and heard nothing of the habit so generally noticed among
other Eskimo and in Siberia of eating the half-digested contents of the
stomach of the reindeer, but we found that they were fond of the fæces
taken from the rectum of the deer. I&nbsp;find that this curious habit
has been noticed among Eskimo only in two other places&mdash;Greenland
in former times and Boothia Felix. The Greenlanders ate “the Dung of the
Rein-deer, taken out of the Guts when they clean them; the Entrails of
Partridges and the like Out-cast, pass for Dainties with them.”<a class

considered a great delicacy and are carefully cooked as a separate
dish.<a class = "tag" name = "tag102" id = "tag102" href =

<p>As far as our observations go these people eat little, if any, more
fat than civilized man, and, as a rule, not by itself. Fat may
occasionally be eaten (they are fond of the fat on the inside of duck
skins), but they do not habitually eat the great quantities of blubber
spoken of in some other places<a class = "tag" name = "tag103" id =
"tag103" href = "#note103">103</a> or drink oil, as the Hudson Bay
Eskimo are said to do by Hall, or use it as a sauce for dry food, like
the natives of Norton Sound. It is usually supposed and generally stated
in the popular accounts of the Eskimo that it is a physiological
necessity for them to eat enormous quantities of blubber in order to
obtain a sufficient amount of carbon to enable them to maintain their
animal heat in the cold climate which they inhabit. A&nbsp;careful
comparison, however, of the reports of actual observers<a class = "tag"
name = "tag104" id = "tag104" href = "#note104">104</a> shows that an
excessive eating of fat is not the rule, and is perhaps confined to the
territory near Boothia Felix.</p>

<p>Eggs of all kinds, except, of course, the smallest, are eagerly
sought for, but the smaller birds are seldom eaten, as it is a waste of
time and ammunition to pursue them. We saw this people eat no vegetable
substances, though they informed us that the buds of the willow were
sometimes eaten. Of late years they have acquired a fondness for many
kinds of civilized food, especially bread of any kind, flour, sugar, and
molasses, and some of them are learning to like salt. They were very
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page63" id = "page63">
63</a></span>
glad to purchase from us corn-meal “mush” and the broken victuals from
the table. These were, however, considered as special dainties and eaten
as luncheons or as a dessert after the regular meal. The children and
even some of the women were always on the watch for the cook’s slop
bucket to be brought out, and vied with the ubiquitous dogs in searching
for scraps of food. Meat which epicures would call rather “high” is
eaten with relish, but they seem to prefer fresh meat when they can get
it.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "subsistence_food_preparing" id =
"subsistence_food_preparing" href = "#subsistence_food">Means of
preparing food.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>Food is generally cooked, except, perhaps, whale-skin and whale gum,
which usually seem to be eaten as soon as obtained, without waiting for
a fire. Meat of all kinds is generally boiled in abundance of water over
a fire of driftwood, and the broth thus made is drunk hot before eating
the meat. Fowls are prepared for boiling by skinning them. Fish are also
boiled, but are often eaten raw, especially in winter at the
deer-hunting camps, when they are frozen hard. Meat is sometimes eaten
raw or frozen. Lieut. Ray found one family in camp on Kulugrua who had
no fire of any kind, and were eating everything raw. They had run out of
oil some time before and did not like to spend time in going to the
coast for more while deer were plentiful.</p>

<p>When traveling in winter, according to Lieut. Ray, they prefer frozen
fish or a sort of pemmican made as follows: The marrow is extracted from
reindeer bones by boiling, and to a quantity of this is added 2 or 3
pounds of crushed seal or whale blubber, and the whole beaten up with
the hands in a large wooden bowl to the consistency of frozen cream.
Into this they stir bits of boiled venison, generally the poorer
portions of the meat scraped off the bone, and chewed up small by all
the women and children of the family, “each using some cabalistic word
as they cast in their mouthful.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag105" id =
"tag105" href = "#note105">105</a> The mass is made up into 2-pound
balls and carried in little sealskin bags. Flour, when obtained, is made
into a sort of porridge, of which they are very fond. Cooking is mostly
done outside of the dwelling, in the open air in summer, or in kitchens
opening out of the passageway in winter. Little messes only, like an
occasional dish of soup or porridge, are cooked over the lamps in the
house. This habit, of course, comes from the abundant supply of
firewood, while the Eskimo most frequently described live in a country
where wood is very scarce, and are obliged to depend on oil for
fuel.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "subsistence_food_time" id =
"subsistence_food_time" href = "#subsistence_food">Time and frequency of
eating.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>When these people are living in the winter houses they do not, as far
as we could learn, have any regular time for meals, but eat whenever
they are hungry and have leisure. The women seem to keep a supply of
cooked food on hand ready for any one to eat. When the men are working
in the kû´dyĭgi, or “club house,” or when a number of them are encamped
together in tents, as at the whaling camp in 1883, or the regular summer
camp at Pe´rnyû, the women at intervals through the day prepare dishes
of meat, which the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page64" id = "page64">
64</a></span>
men eat by themselves. When in the deer-hunting camps, according to
Lieut. Ray, they eat but little in the morning, and can really be said
to take no more than one full meal a day, which is eaten at night when
the day’s work is done.<a class = "tag" name = "tag106" id = "tag106"
href = "#note106">106</a> When on the march they usually take a few
mouthfuls of the pemmican above described before they start out in the
morning, and rarely touch food again till they go into camp at
night.</p>

<p>When a family returns from the spring deer hunt with plenty of
venison they usually keep open house for a day or two. The women of the
household, with sometimes the assistance of a neighbor or two, keep the
pot continually boiling, sending in dishes of meat at intervals, while
the house is full of guests who stay for a short time, eating, smoking,
and chatting, and then retire to make room for others. Messes are
sometimes sent out to invalids who can not come to the feast. One
household in the spring of 1883 consumed in this way two whole reindeer
in 24 hours. They use only their hands and a knife in eating meat,
usually filling the mouth and cutting or biting off the mouthful. They
are large eaters, some of them, especially the women, eating all the
time when they have plenty, but we never saw them gorge themselves in
the manner described by Dr. Kane (2d&nbsp;Grinnell Exp., passim) and
other writers.</p>

<p>Their habits of hospitality prevent their laying up any large supply
of meat, though blubber is carefully saved for commercial use, and they
depend for subsistence, almost from day to day, on their success in
hunting. When encamped, however, in small parties in the summer they
often take more seals than they can consume. The carcasses of these,
stripped of their skins and blubber, are buried in the gravel close to
the camp, and dug up and brought home when meat becomes scarce in the
winter.</p>


<h5><a name = "subsistence_drinks" id = "subsistence_drinks" href =
"#subsistence">DRINKS.</a></h5>

<p>The habitual drink is water, which these people consume in great
quantities when they can obtain it, and like to have very cold. In the
winter there is always a lump of clean snow on a rack close to the lamp,
with a tub under it to catch the water that drips from it. This is
replaced in the summer by a bucket of fresh water from some pond or
lake. When the men are sitting in their open air clubs at the summer
camps there is always a bucket of fresh water in the middle of the
circle, with a dipper to drink from. Hardly a native ever passed the
station without stopping for a drink of water, often drinking a quart of
cold water at a time. When tramping about in the winter they eat large
quantities of ice and snow, and on the march the women carry small
canteens of sealskin, which they fill with snow and carry inside of
their jackets, where the heat of the body melts the snow and keeps
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page65" id = "page65">
65</a></span>
it liquid. This great fondness for plenty of cold water has been often
noticed among the Eskimo elsewhere, and appears to be quite
characteristic of the race.<a class = "tag" name = "tag107" id =
"tag107" href = "#note107">107</a> They have acquired a taste for
liquor, and like to get enough to produce intoxication. As well as we
could judge, they are easily affected by alcohol. Some of them during
our stay learned to be very fond of coffee, “ka´fe,” but tea they are
hardly acquainted with, though they will drink it. I&nbsp;have noticed
that they sometimes drank the water produced by the melting of the sea
ice along the beach, and pronounced it excellent when it was so brackish
that I found it quite undrinkable.</p>


<h5><a name = "subsistence_narcotics" id = "subsistence_narcotics" href

<p>The only narcotic in use among these people is tobacco, which they
obtain directly or indirectly from the whites, and which has been in use
among them from the earliest time when we have any knowledge of them.
When Mr. Elson, in the <i>Blossom’s</i> barge, visited Point Barrow, in
1826, he found tobacco in general use and the most marketable article.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag108" id = "tag108" href = "#note108">108</a>
This undoubtedly came from the Russians by way of Siberia and Bering
Strait, as Kotzebue found the natives of the sound which bears his name,
who were in communication with the Asiatic coast by way of the Diomedes,
already addicted to the use of tobacco in 1816. It is not probable that
tobacco was introduced on the Arctic coast by way of the Russian
settlements in Alaska. There were no Russian posts north of Bristol Bay
until 1833, when St. Michael’s Redoubt was built. When Capt. Cook
visited Bristol Bay, in 1778, he found that tobacco was not used
there,<a class = "tag" name = "tag109" id = "tag109" href =
"#note109">109</a> while in Norton Sound, the same year, the natives
“had no dislike to tobacco.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag110" id =
"tag110" href = "#note110">110</a> Neither was it introduced from the
English posts in the east, as Franklin found the “Kûñmû´dlĭñ” not in the
habit of using it&mdash;“The western Esquimaux use tobacco, and some of
our visitors had smoked it, but thought the flavor very disagreeable,”<a
class = "tag" name = "tag111" id = "tag111" href =
"#note111">111</a>&mdash;nor had they adopted the habit in 1837.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag112" id = "tag112" href = "#note112">112</a></p>

<p>When the <i>Plover</i> wintered at Point Barrow, according to Dr.
Simpson’s account,<a class = "tag" name = "tag113" id = "tag113" href =
"#note113">113</a> all the tobacco, except a little obtained from the
English discovery ships, came from Asia and was brought by the
Nunatañmiun. At present the latter bring very little if any tobacco, and
the supply is obtained directly from the ships, though a little
occasionally finds its way up the coast from the southwest.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page66" id = "page66">
66</a></span>
<p>They use all kinds of tobacco, but readily distinguish and desire the
sorts considered better by the whites. For instance, they were eager to
get the excellent quality of “Navy” tobacco furnished by the Commissary
Department, while one of our party who had a large quantity of
exceedingly bad fine-cut tobacco could hardly give it away.
A&nbsp;little of the strong yellow “Circassian” tobacco used by the
Russians for trading is occasionally brought up from the southwest, and
perhaps also by the Nunatañmiun, and is very highly prized, probably
because it was in this form that they first saw tobacco. Snuff seems to
be unknown; tobacco is used only for chewing and smoking. The habit of
chewing tobacco is almost universal. Men, women, and even children,
though the latter be but 2 or 3 years old and unweaned,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag114" id = "tag114" href = "#note114">114</a> when tobacco is
to be obtained, keep a “chew,” often of enormous size, constantly in the
mouth. The juice is not spit out, but swallowed with the saliva, without
producing any signs of nausea. The tobacco is chewed by itself and not
sweetened with sugar, as was observed by Hooper and Nordenskiöld among
the “Chukches.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag115" id = "tag115" href =
"#note115">115</a> I&nbsp;knew but two adult Eskimo in Utkiavwĭñ who did
not chew tobacco, and one of these adopted the habit to a certain extent
while we were there.</p>

<p>Tobacco is smoked in pipes of a peculiar pattern called kui´nyɐ, of
which the collection contains a series of ten specimens.</p>

<p>Of these, No. 89288 [705],<a class = "tag" name = "tag116" id =
"tag116" href = "#note116">116</a> figured in Ray’s Point Barrow Report,
Ethnology, Pl. <span class = "smallroman">I</span>, Fig. 1, will serve
as a type. The bowl is of brass, neatly inlaid on the upper surface with
a narrow ring of copper close to the edge, from which run four
converging lines, 90° apart, nearly to the center. Round the under
surface are also three concentric rings of copper. The wooden stem
appears to be willow or birch, and is in two longitudinal sections, held
together by the lashing of sealskin thong which serves to attach the
bowl to the stem. This lashing was evidently put on wet and allowed to
shrink on, and the ends are secured by tucking under the turns. The
whipping at the mouthpiece is of fine sinew thread. A&nbsp;picker of
steel for cleaning out the bowl is attached to the stem by a piece of
seal thong, the end of which is wedged under the turns of the lashing.
The remaining pipes are all of the same general pattern, but vary in the
material of the bowl and in details of execution. The stems are always
of the same material and put together in the same way, but are sometimes
lozenge-shaped instead of elliptical in section. The lashing is
sometimes of three-ply sinew braid. The bowl shows the greatest
variation, both in form and material.</p>

<p>Fig. 6<i>a</i> (No. 56737 [10], from Utkiavwĭñ) has an iron bowl,
noticeable for the ornamentation of the shank. The metal work has all
been done with the file except the fitting of the saucer to the shank.
This has evidently been heated and shrunk on. Three pipes have bowls of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page67" id = "page67">
67</a></span>
smoothly ground stone. No. 89289 [1582] (Fig. 6<i>b</i> from Utkiavwĭñ)
is of rather soft greenish gray slate. No. 89290 [864] is of the same
shape, but of hard greenish stone, while the third stone pipe
(No.&nbsp;89291 [834], from Utkiavwĭñ), of gray slate, is of quite a
different pattern. Three of the series have bowls of reindeer antler,
lined with thin sheet brass, and one a bowl of walrus ivory, lined with
thin copper. (See Fig. 6<i>c</i>, Nos. 89285 [954], 89286 [915], and
89287 [1129].)</p>

<p>Antler and stone pipes of this pattern and rather small are usually
carried by the men out of doors, while the more elaborate metal pipes,
which are often very large and handsome (I&nbsp;have seen some with a
saucer at least 3 inches in diameter) are more frequently used in the
house and by the women. The stem is usually 1 foot or 13 inches long,
though pipes at least 18 inches long were seen.</p>

<p>To most pipes are attached pickers, as in the type specimen. The
picker is in all cases of metal, usually iron or steel, but sometimes of
copper (see the pickers attached to pipes above). When not in use the
point is tucked under the lashing on the stem. The pipes are readily
taken apart for cleaning.</p>

<p>No. 89292 [1752] (Fig. 7) is an extemporized pipe made in a hurry by

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;Pipe made of willow
stick.</p>

<p>It is simply a rough willow stick, slightly whittled into shape,
split and hollowed out like a pipestem. It is held together by a
whipping of sinew thread and a lashing of deerskin thong, fastened by a
slip-knot at one end, the other being tucked in as usual. A&nbsp;small
funnel-shaped hole at one end serves for a bowl, and shows by its
charred surface that it has been actually used. This pipe was bought
from one of the “Nunatañmiun,” who were in camp at Pernyû in 1883, and
shows its inland origin in the use of the deerskin thong. A&nbsp;coast
native would have used seal thong.</p>

<p>The pipe is carried at the girdle, either with the stem thrust inside
the breeches or in a bag attached to the belt. No. 56744 [55]
(Utkiavwĭñ) is the only specimen of pipe bag in the collection. It is a
long, narrow, cylindric bag, made of four white ermine skins, with two
hind legs and two tails forming a fringe round the bottom, which is of
dressed deerskin, in one piece, flesh side out. The band round the mouth
is of gray deerskin, running only two-thirds of the way round. The piece
which fills the remaining third runs out into the strap for fastening
the bag to the belt. The ornamental strips on two of the longitudinal
seams and round the bottom are of deerskin. The seams are all sewed
“over and over” on the “wrong” side with sinew thread. This is an
unusually handsome bag.</p>

<p>Tobacco is carried in a small pouch of fur attached to the girdle,
and tucked inside of the breeches, or sometimes worn under the jacket,
slung round the neck by a string or the necklace. The collection
contains three of these, of which No. 89803 [889] (Fig. 8<i>a</i>) will
serve as a typical specimen.</p>

<p>It is made by sewing together two pieces of wolverine fur, hair out,
of the same shape and size, and round the mouth of this a band of
short-haired light-colored deerskin, also hair out, with the ends
meeting at one side in a seam corresponding to one of the seams of the
wolverine fur. The mouth is ornamented with a narrow band of wolverine
fur, the flesh side, which is colored red, turned out. It is closed by a
piece of seal thong about 5 inches long, one end of which is sewed to
the middle of the seam in the deerskin band and the other passed through
a large blue glass bead and knotted. This string is wound two or three
times round the neck of the bag, and the bight of it tucked under the

<p>These tobacco pouches are usually of a similar pattern, often
slightly narrowed at the neck, and generally fringed round the mouth
with a narrow strip of wolverine fur as above. They are often ornamented
with tags of wolverine fur on the seams (as&nbsp;in No. 89804 [1341,
Fig. 8<i>b</i>]), and borders of different colored skin. No. 89805
[1350] is very elaborately ornamented. It is made of brown deerskin,
trimmed with white deerskin clipped close and bordered with narrow
braids of blue and red worsted, and little tags of the latter. According
to Dr. Simpson,<a class = "tag" name = "tag117" id = "tag117" href =
"#note117">117</a> these bags are called “del-la-mai´-yu.” We neglected
to obtain the proper names for them, as we always made use of the lingua
franca “tiba´ púksak,” bag for tiba´ (tobacco). No. 89903 [889] contains
a specimen of tobacco as prepared for smoking by the Eskimo. This
consists of common black Cavendish or “Navy” tobacco, cut up very fine,
and mixed with finely chopped wood in the proportion of about two parts
of tobacco to one of wood. We were informed that willow twigs were used
for this purpose. Perhaps this may have some slight aromatic flavor, as
well as serving to make the tobacco go further, though I did not
recognize any such flavor in some tobacco from an Eskimo’s pouch that I
once smoked and found exceedingly bad. The smell of an Eskimo’s
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page70" id = "page70">

pipe is different from any other tobacco smoke and is very disagreeable.
It has some resemblance to the smell of some of the cheaper brands of
North Carolina tobacco which are known to be adulterated with other
vegetable substances. The method of smoking is as follows: After
clearing out the bowl with the picker, a&nbsp;little wad of deer hair,
plucked from the clothes in some inconspicuous place, generally the
front skirt of the inner jacket, is rammed down to the bottom of the
bowl. This is to prevent the fine tobacco from getting into the stem and
clogging it up. The bowl is then filled with tobacco, of which it only
holds a very small quantity. The mouthpiece is placed between the lips,
the tobacco ignited, and all smoked out in two or three strong
inhalations. The smoke is very deeply inhaled and allowed to pass out
slowly from the mouth and nostrils, bringing tears to the eyes, often
producing giddiness, and almost always a violent fit of coughing.
I&nbsp;have seen a man almost prostrated from the effects of a single
pipeful. This method of smoking has been in vogue since the time of our
first acquaintance with these people.<a class = "tag" name = "tag118" id
= "tag118" href = "#note118">118</a></p>

<p>Though they smoke little at a time, they smoke frequently when
tobacco is plentiful. Of late years, since tobacco has become plentiful,
some have adopted white men’s pipes, which they smoke without inhaling,
and they are glad to get cigars, and, since our visit, cigarettes. In
conversation with us they usually called all means for smoking “pai´pa,”
the children sometimes specifying “pai´pa-sigya´” (cigar) or
“mûkparapai´pa,” paper-pipe (cigarette). The use of the kui´nyɐ, which
name appears to be applied only to the native pipes, seems to be
confined to the adults. We knew of no children owning them, though their
parents made no objection to their chewing tobacco or owning or using
clay or wooden pipes which they obtained from us. They carry their
fondness for tobacco so far that they will even eat the foul oily refuse
from the bottom of the bowl, the smallest portion of which would produce
nausea in a white man. This habit has been observed at Plover Bay,
Siberia.<a class = "tag" name = "tag119" id = "tag119" href =
"#note119">119</a> Tobacco ashes are also eaten, probably for the sake
of the potash they contain, as one of the men at Utkiavwīñ was fond of
carbonate of soda, which he told the doctor was just like what he got
from his pipe. Pipes of this type, differing in details, but all
agreeing in having very small bowls, frequently of metal, and some
contrivance for opening the stem, are used by the Eskimo from at least
as far south as the Yukon delta (as&nbsp;shown by the collections in the
National Museum) to the

Anderson River and Cape Bathurst,<a class = "tag" name = "tag120" id =
"tag120" href = "#note120">120</a> and have even been adopted by the
Indians of the Yukon, who learned the use of tobacco from the Eskimo.
They are undoubtedly of Siberian origin, as will be seen by comparing
the figure of a “Chukch” pipe in Nordenskiöld’s Vega, vol. 2,
p.&nbsp;117, Fig. 7, and the figure of a Tunguse pipe in Seebohm’s
“Siberia in Asia” (p.&nbsp;149), with the pipes figured from our
collection. Moreover, the method of smoking is precisely that practiced
in Siberia, even to the proportion of wood mixed with the tobacco.<a

<p>The consideration of the question whence the Siberians acquired this
peculiar method of smoking would lead me beyond the bounds of the
present work, but I can not leave the subject of pipes without calling
attention to the fact that Nordenskiöld<a class = "tag" name = "tag122"
id = "tag122" href = "#note122">122</a> has alluded to the resemblance
of these to the Japanese pipes. A&nbsp;gentleman who has spent many
years in China also informs me that the Chinese pipes are of a very
similar type and smoked in much the same way.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag123" id = "tag123" href = "#note123">123</a> The Greenlanders and
eastern Eskimo generally, who have learned the use of tobacco directly
from the Europeans, use large-bowled pipes, which they smoke in the
ordinary manner. In talking with us the people of Point Barrow call
tobacco “tiba´” or “tibakĭ,” but among themselves it is still known as
ta´wak, which is the word found in use among them by the earliest
explorers.<a class = "tag" name = "tag124" id = "tag124" href =
"#note124">124</a> “Tiba” was evidently learned from the American
whalers, as it was not in use in Dr. Simpson’s time. It is merely an
attempt to pronounce the word tobacco, but has been adopted into the

language sufficiently to be used as the radical in compound words such
as “tiba´xutikă´ktûñɐ,” “I&nbsp;have a supply of tobacco.” There is no
evidence that anything else was smoked before the introduction of
tobacco, and no pipes seen or collected appear older than the time when
we know them to have had tobacco.<a class = "tag" name = "tag125" id =

<p>The permanent winter houses are built of wood<a class = "tag" name =
"tag126" id = "tag126" href = "#note126">126</a> and thickly covered
with clods of earth. Each house consists of a single room, nearly
square, entered by an underground passage about 25 feet long and 4 to 4½
feet high. The sloping mound of earth which covers the house, grading
off insensibly to the level of the ground, gives the houses the
appearance of being underground, especially as the land on which they
stand is irregular and hilly. Without very careful measurements, which
we were unable to make, it is impossible to tell whether the floor is
above or below the surface of the ground. It is certainly not very far
either way. I&nbsp;am inclined to think that a space
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page73" id = "page73">
73</a></span>
at or near the top of a hillock is simply leveled to receive the floor.
In this case the back of the house on a hill side, like some in
Utkiavwĭñ, would be underground.</p>

<p>The passage is entered at the farther end by a vertical shaft about 6
feet deep in the center of a steep mound of earth. Round the mouth is a
square frame or combing of wood, and blocks of wood are placed in the
shaft to serve as steps. One or two houses in Utkiavwĭñ had ship’s
companion ladders in the shaft. This entrance can be closed with a piece
of walrus hide or a wooden cover in severe weather or when the family is
away. The passage is about 4 feet wide and the sides and roof are
supported by timbers of whalebone. On the right hand near the inner end
is a good-sized room opening from the passage, which has a wooden roof
covered with earth, forming a second small mound close to the house,
with a smoke hole in the middle, and serves as a kitchen, while various
dark and irregular recesses on the other side serve as storerooms. The
passage is always icy and dark.</p>

<p>At the inner end of the passage a circular trapdoor in the floor
opens into the main room of the house, close to the wall at the middle
of one end. The floor is at such a height from the bottom of the tunnel
that a man standing erect in the tunnel has his head and shoulders in
the room. These rooms vary somewhat in dimensions, but are generally
about 12 or 14 feet long and 8 or 10 feet wide. The floor, walls, and
roof are made of thick planks of driftwood, dressed smooth and neatly
fitted together, edge to edge. The ridgepole runs across the house and
the roof slopes toward each end. The two slopes are unequal, the front,
or that towards the entrance, being considerably the longer. The walls
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page74" id = "page74">
74</a></span>
are vertical, those at the ends being between 3 and 4 feet high, while
the sides run up to 6 or 7 feet at the ridgepole. The wall planks run up
and down, and those of the roof from the ridge to the ends of the house,
where there is a stout horizontal timber. In some houses the walls are
made of paneled bulkheads from some wrecked whaler.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;Interior of iglu,

<p>In the front of the house over the trapdoor there are no planks for a
space of about 2 feet. The lower part of this space is filled in with
short transverse beams, so as to leave a square hole close to the ridge.
This hole has a stout transverse beam at the top and bottom and serves
as a window. When the house is occupied it is covered by a translucent
membrane made of strips of seal entrail sewed together and stretched
over two arched sticks of light wood&mdash;whalebone was used in Dr.
Simpson’s time<a class = "tag" name = "tag127" id = "tag127" href =
"#note127">127</a>&mdash;running diagonally across from corner to
corner. The window is closed with a wooden shutter when the house is
shut up in winter, but both apertures are left open in summer. Just
above the window, close to the ridgepole, is a little aperture for
ventilation. Across the back of the room runs a platform or banquette,
about 30 inches high in front and sloping back a little, which serves as
a sleeping and lounging place. It is about 5 feet wide, and the front
edge comes nearly under the ridgepole. It is made of thick planks
running across the house, and supported at each end by a horizontal
beam, the end of which projects somewhat beyond the bench and is
supported by a round post. At each side of the house stands a lamp, and
over these are suspended racks in the shape of small ladders for drying
clothing,<a class = "tag" name = "tag128" id = "tag128" href =
"#note128">128</a> etc. Deerskin blankets
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page75" id = "page75">

for the bed, which are rolled up and put under the bench when not in
use, and a number of wooden tubs of various sizes&mdash;I counted nine
tubs and buckets in one house in Utkiavwĭñ&mdash;complete the
furniture.</p>

<p>Two families usually occupy such a house, in which case each wife has
her own end of the room and her own lamp, near which on the floor she
usually sits to work. Some houses contain but one family and others
more. I&nbsp;knew one house in Utkiavwĭñ whose regular occupants were
thirteen in number, namely, a&nbsp;father with his wife and adopted
daughter, two married sons each with a wife and child, his widowed
sister with her son and his wife, and one little girl. This house was
also the favorite stopping-place for people who came down from Nuwŭk to
spend the night. The furniture is always arranged in the same way. There
is only one rack on the right side of the house and two on the left. Of
these the farther from the lamp is the place for the lump of snow. In
this same corner are kept the tubs, and the large general chamber pot
and the small male urinal are near the trap door. Dishes of cooked meat
are also kept in this corner. This leaves the other corner of the house
vacant for women visitors, who sit there and sew. Male visitors, as well
as the men of the house when they have nothing to do, usually sit on the
edge of the banquette.</p>

<p>In sleeping they usually lie across the banquette with their feet to
the wall, but sometimes, when there are few people in the house, lie
lengthwise, and occasionally sleep on the floor under the banquette.
Petitot says that in the Mackenzie region only married people sleep with
their heads toward the edge of the banquette. Children and visitors lie
with their heads the other way.<a class = "tag" name = "tag129" id =
"tag129" href = "#note129">129</a> (See Fig. 9, ground plan and section
of house, and Figs. 10 and 11, interior, from sketches by the writer.
For outside see Fig. 12, from a photograph by Lieut. Ray).</p>

<p>At the back of the house is a high oblong scaffolding, made by
setting up tall poles of driftwood, four, six, or eight in number, and
fastening on cross pieces about 8 or 10 feet from the ground, usually in
two tiers, of which the lower supports the frames of the kaiaks and the
upper spears and other bulky property. Nothing except very heavy
articles, such as sledges, boxes, and barrels, is ever left on the
ground. A&nbsp;man can easily reach this scaffold from the top of the
house, but it is high enough to be out of reach of the dogs. The cross
pieces are usually supported on crotches made by lashing the lower jaw
of a walrus to the pole, so that one ramus lies along the latter.
Scaffolds of this sort, usually spoken of as “caches” or “cache frames,”
are of necessity used among the Eskimos generally, as it is the only way
in which they can protect their bulky property.<a class = "tag" name =

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page76" id = "page76">

<p>Around Norton Sound, however, they use a more elaborate structure,
consisting of a regular little house 6 feet square, raised 6 to 10 feet
from the ground on four posts.<a class = "tag" name = "tag131" id =
"tag131" href = "#note131">131</a></p>

<p>Belonging to each household, and usually near the house, are low
scaffolds for the large boats, rows of posts for stretching lines of
thong, and one or more small cellars or underground rooms framed with
whales’ bones, the skull being frequently used for a roof, which serve
as storehouses for blubber. These may be called “blubber rooms.”</p>

<p>These winter houses can only be occupied when the weather is cold
enough to keep the ground hard frozen. During the summer the passageways
are full of water, which freezes at the beginning of winter and is dug
out with a pickax. The people of Utkiavwĭñ began to come to us to borrow
our pickax to clean out their iglus about September 24, 1882, and all
the houses were vacated before July 1, both seasons.</p>

<p>This particular form of winter house, though in general like those
built by other Eskimo, nevertheless differs in many respects from any
described elsewhere. For instance, the Greenland house was an oblong
flat-roofed building of turf and stones, with the passageway in the
middle of one side instead of one end, and not underground. Still, the
door and windows were all on one side, and the banquette or “brix” only
on the side opposite the entrance. The windows were formerly made of
seal entrails, and the passage, though not underground, was still lower
than the floor of the house, so that it was necessary to step up at each
end.<a class = "tag" name = "tag132" id = "tag132" href =

Greenlanders, of which, there is only one at each village, will be found
in Capt. Holm’s paper in the Geografisk Tidskrift, vol. 8, pp. 87-89.
This is the long house of West Greenland, still further elongated till
it will accommodate “half a score of families, that is to say, 30 to 50
people.” John Davis (1586) describes the houses of the Greenlanders
“neere the Sea side,” which were made with pieces of wood on both sides,
and crossed over with poles and then covered over with earth.<a class =

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page78" id = "page78">

large triple house described by Dr. Simpson, and compared by him with
that described by Richardson, though in some respects it more closely
resembles those seen by Hooper.<a class = "tag" name = "tag138" id =
"tag138" href = "#note138">138</a> This house really has a fireplace in

form, built of undressed timber, and sometimes of very small dimensions,
with two recesses opposite each other, and raised a foot above the
middle space, is very common on the shores of Kotzebue Sound,” but he
does not make it plain whether houses like those used at Point Barrow
are not used there also.</p>

<p>This form of house is very like the large snow houses seen by Lieut.
Ray at hunting camps on Kulugrua. Dr. Simpson describes less permanent
structures which are used on the rivers, consisting of small trees split
and laid “inclining inward in a pyramidal form towards a rude square
frame in the center, supported by two or more upright posts. Upon these
the smaller branches of the felled trees are placed, and the whole,
except the aperture at the top and a small opening on one side, is
covered with earth or only snow.”<a class = "tag" href =
"#note139">139b</a> These buildings, and especially the temporary ones
described by Dr. Simpson, used on the Nunatak, probably gave rise to the
statement we heard at Point Barrow that “the people south had no iglus
and lived only in tents.” The houses at Norton Sound are quite different
from the Point Barrow form. The floor, which is not planked, is 3 or 4
feet under ground, and the passage enters one side of the house, instead
of coming up through the floor, and a small shed is built over the outer
entrance to the passage. The fire is built in the middle of the house,
under the aperture in the roof which serves for chimney and window, and
there is seldom any banquette, but the two ends of the room are fenced
off by logs laid on the ground, to serve as sleeping places, straw and
spruce boughs being laid down and covered with grass mats.<a class =

<p>The village of Utkiavwĭñ occupies a narrow strip of ground along the
edge of the cliffs of Cape Smyth, about 1,000 yards long, and extending
some 150 yards inland. The houses are scattered among the hillocks
without any attempt at regularity and at different distances from each
other, sometimes alone, and sometimes in groups of two contiguous
houses, which often have a common cache frame. Nuwŭk, from Dr. Simpson’s
account<a class = "tag" name = "tag144" id = "tag144" href =
"#note144">144</a> and what we saw in our hurried visits, is scattered
in the same way over the knolls of Point Barrow, but has its greatest
extension in an east and west direction. From Simpson’s account (ibid.)
double houses appear more common at Nuwŭk than at Utkiavwĭñ, and he even
speaks of a few threefold ones. All the houses agree in facing south.
This is undoubtedly to admit the greatest amount of light in winter, and
seems to be a tolerably general custom, at least among the northern
Eskimo.<a class = "tag" name = "tag145" id = "tag145" href =
"#note145">145</a></p>

<p>The custom of having the dwelling face south appears to be a deeply
rooted one, as even the tents in summer all face the same way.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag146" id = "tag146" href = "#note146">146</a></p>

<p>The tents on the sandspit at Plover Bay all face west. The same was
observed by the Krause brothers at East Cape.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag147" id = "tag147" href = "#note147">147</a> At Utkiavwĭñ there are
twenty-six or twenty-seven inhabited houses. The uninhabited are mostly
ruins and are chiefly at the southwest end of the village, though the
breaking away of the cliffs at the other end has exposed the ruins of a
few other old houses. Near these are also the ruins of the buildings
destroyed by the ice catastrophe described above (<a href =
"#page31">p.&nbsp;31</a>). The mounds at the site of the United States
signal station are also the ruins of old iglus. We were told that “long
ago,” before they had any iron, five families who “talked like dogs”
inhabited this village. They were called Isû´tkwamiun. Similar mounds
are to be seen at Pernyû, near the present summer camp. About these we
only learned that people lived there “long ago.” We also heard of ruined
houses on the banks of Kulugrua.</p>

<p>Besides the dwellings there are in Utkiavwĭñ three and in Nuwŭk two
of the larger buildings used for dancing, and as workrooms for the men,
so often spoken of among other Eskimo.</p>

<p>Dr. Simpson states<a class = "tag" name = "tag148" id = "tag148" href
= "#note148">148</a> that they are nominally the property of some of the
more wealthy men. We did not hear of this, nor did we ever hear the
different buildings distinguished as “So-and-so’s,” as I am inclined to
think would have been the case had the custom still prevailed. They are
called kû´dyĭgi or kû´drĭgi (karrigi of Simpson), a&nbsp;word which
corresponds, mutatis mutandis, with the Greenlandic kagsse, which means,
first, a&nbsp;circle of hills round a small deep valley, and then a
circle of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page80" id = "page80">
80</a></span>
people who sit close together (and then, curiously enough,
a&nbsp;brothel). At Utkiavwĭñ they are situated about the middle of the
village, one close to the bank and the others at the other edge of the
village. They are built like the other houses, but are broader than
long, with the ridgepole in the middle, so that the two slopes of the
roof are equal, and are not covered with turf, like the dwellings, being
only partially banked up with earth.</p>

<p>The one visited by Lieut. Ray on the occasion of the “tree dance” was
16 by 20 feet and 7 feet high under the ridge, and held sixty people. In
the fall and spring, when it is warm enough to sit in the kû´dyĭgi
without fire and with the window open, it is used as a general lounging
place or club room by the men. Those who have carpentering and similar
work to do bring it there and others come simply to lounge and gossip
and hear the latest news, as the hunters when they come in generally
repair to the kû´dyĭgi as soon as they have put away their
equipments.</p>

<p>They are so fond of this general resort that when nearly the whole
village was encamped at Imêkpûñ in the spring of 1883, to be near the
whaling ground, they extemporized a club house by arranging four timbers
large enough for seats in a hollow square near the middle of the camp.
The men take turns in catering for the club, each man’s wife furnishing
and cooking the food for the assembled party when her husband’s turn
comes. The club house, however, is not used as a sleeping place for the

<p>The kû´dyĭgi is not used in the winter, probably on account of the
difficulty of warming it, except on the occasions of the dances,
festivals, or conjuring ceremonies. Crevices in the walls are then
covered with blocks of snow, a&nbsp;slab of transparent ice is fitted
into the window, and the house is lighted and heated with lamps.
Buildings of this sort and used for essentially the same purposes have
been observed among nearly all known Eskimo, except the Greenlanders,
who, however, still retain the tradition of such structures.<a class =

<p>Houses of snow are used only temporarily, as for instance at the
hunting grounds on the rivers, and occasionally by visitors at the
village who prefer having their own quarters. For example, a&nbsp;man
and his wife who had been living at Nuwŭk decided in the winter of
1882-’83 to come down and settle at Utkiavwĭñ, where the woman’s parents
lived. Instead of going to one of the houses in the village, they built
themselves a snow house in which they spent the winter. The man said he
intended to <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads‘built’">build</ins> a&nbsp;wooden house the next season. These houses
are not built on the dome or beehive shape so often described among the
Eskimo of the middle region of Dr. Rink.<a class = "tag" name = "tag154"
id = "tag154" href = "#note154">154</a></p>

<p>The idea naturally suggests itself that this form of building is
really a snow <i>tupek</i> or tent, while the form used at Point Barrow
is simply the iglu built of snow instead of wood. When built on level
ground, as in the village, the snow house consists of an oblong room
about 6 feet by 12, with walls made of blocks of snow, and high enough
for a person to stand up inside. Beams or poles are laid across the top,
and over these is stretched a roof of canvas. At the south end is a low
narrow covered passage of snow about 10 feet long leading to a low door
not over 2½ feet high, above which is the window, made, as before
described, of seal entrail. The opening at the outer end of the passage
is at the top, so that one climbs over a low wall of snow to enter the
house.</p>

<p>At the right side of the passage, close to the house, is a small
fireplace about 2½ feet square and built of slabs of snow, with a smoke
hole in the top and a stick stuck across at the proper height to hang a
pot on. When the first fire is built in such a fireplace there is
considerable melting of the surface of the snow, but as soon as the fire
is allowed to go out this freezes to a hard glaze of ice, which
afterwards melts only to a trifling extent. Opposite to the door of the
house, which is protected by a curtain of canvas, corresponding to the
Greenlandic ubkuaĸ, “a&nbsp;skin which is hung up before the entrance of
the house,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag155" id = "tag155" href =
"#note155">155</a> the floor is raised into a banquette about 18 inches
high, on which are laid boards and skins. Cupboards are excavated under
the banquette, or in the walls, and pegs are driven into the walls to
hang things on.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page82" id = "page82">

As such a house is only large enough for one family, there is only one
lamp, which stands at the right-hand side of the house<a class = "tag"

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 14.&mdash;Ground plan of large
snow house.</p>

<p>At the hunting grounds, or on the road thither in the winter,
a&nbsp;place is selected for the house where the snow is deeply drifted
under the edge of some bank, so that most of the house can be made by
excavation. When necessary, the walls are built up and roofed over with
slabs of snow. Such a house is very speedily built. The first party that
goes over the road to the hunting ground usually builds houses at the
end of each day’s march, and these serve for the parties coming later,
who have simply to clear out the drifted snow or perhaps make some
slight repairs. On arriving at the hunting ground they establish
themselves in larger and more comfortable houses of the same sort;
generally for two families. Lieut. Ray, who visited these camps, has
drawn the plan represented in Fig. 14. There is a banquette, <i>a</i>,
at each end of the room, which is much broader than long (compare the
form of house common at Kotzebue Sound, mentioned above, <a href =
"#page78">p.&nbsp;78</a>), but only one lamp, on a low shelf of snow,
<i>b</i>, running across the back of the room and excavated below into a
sort of cupboard. There are also similar cupboards, <i>c</i>, at
different places in the walls, and a long tunnel, <i>f</i>, with the
usual storerooms, <i>i</i>, and kitchen, <i>h</i>, from which a branch
tunnel often leads to an adjoining house. The floor is marked <i>d</i>,
the entrance to the tunnel <i>g</i>, and the door <i>e</i>. The house is
lighted by the seal-gut windows of the iglu brought from the
village.</p>

<p>On going into camp the railed sled is stuck points down into the snow
and net-poles, or ice-picks, thrust through the rails, making a
temporary cache frame,<a class = "tag" name = "tag157" id = "tag157"
href = "#note157">157</a> on which are hung bulky
articles&mdash;snowshoes and

"#note158">158</a> Small storehouses of snow or ice are built to contain
provisions. In the autumn, many such houses are built in the village, of
slabs of clear fresh-water ice about 4 inches thick cemented together by
freezing. These resemble the buildings of fresh-water ice at Iglulik,
described by Capt. Lyon.<a class = "tag" name = "tag159" id = "tag159"
href = "#note159">159</a></p>

<p>Other temporary structures of snow, sometimes erected in the village,
serve as workshops. One of these, which was built at the edge of the
village in April, 1883, was an oblong building long enough to hold an
umiak, giving sufficient room to get around it and work, and between 6
and 7 feet high. The walls were of blocks of snow and the roof of canvas
stretched over poles. One end was left open, but covered by a canvas
curtain, and a banquette of snow ran along each side. It was lighted by
oblong slabs of clear ice set into the walls, and warmed by several
lamps. Several men in succession used this house for repairing and
rigging up their umiaks, and others who had whittling to do brought
their work to the same place.</p>

<p>Such boat shops are sometimes built by digging a broad trench in a
snowbank and roofing it with canvas. Women dig small holes in the snow,
which they roof over with canvas and use for work-rooms in which to
dress seal skins. In such cases there is probably some superstitious
reason, which we failed to learn, for not doing the work in the iglu.
The tools used in building the snow houses are the universal wooden
snow-shovel and the ivory snow-knife, for cutting and trimming the
blocks. At the present day saws are very much used for cutting the
blocks, and also large iron knives (whalemen’s “boarding knives,” etc.)
obtained from the ships.</p>

(<i>tupĕk</i>).&mdash;</h6>

<p>During the summer all the natives live in tents, which are pitched on
dry places upon the top of the cliffs or upon the gravel beach, usually
in small camps of four or five tents each. A&nbsp;few families go no
farther than the dry banks just southwest of the village, while the rest
of the inhabitants who have not gone eastward trading or to the rivers
hunting reindeer are strung along the coast. The first camp below
Utkiavwĭñ is just beyond the double lagoon of Nunava, about 4 miles
away, and the rest at intervals of 2 or 3 miles, usually at some little
inlet or stream at places called Sê´kqluka, Nakĕ´drixo, Kuosu´gru,
Nună´ktuau, Ĭpersua, Wă´lăkpa (Refuge Inlet, according to Capt.
Maguire’s map, Parl. Rep. for 1854, opp. p.&nbsp;186), Er´nĭvwĭñ,
Sĭ´ñaru, and Sa´kămna. It is these summer camps seen from passing ships
which have given rise to the accounts of numerous villages along this
coast. There is usually a small camp on the beach at Sĭ´nnyû and one at
Imê´kpûñ, while a few go to Pernyû even early in the season.</p>

<p>As the sea opens the people from the lower camps travel up the coast
and concentrate at Pernyû, where they meet the Nuwuñmiun, the
Nunatañmiun
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page84" id = "page84">
84</a></span>
traders, and the whalemen, and are joined later in the season by the
trading parties returning from the east, all of whom stop for a few days
at Pernyû. On returning to the village also, in September, the tents are
pitched in dry places among the houses and occupied till the latter are
dry enough to live in. Tents are used in the autumnal deer hunts, before
snow enough falls to build snow houses. In the spring of 1883, when the
land floe was very heavy and rough off Utkiavwĭñ, all who were going
whaling in the Utkiavwĭñ boats went into camp with their families in
tents pitched on the crown of the beach at <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘Imêk / pûñ’ without hyphen at line
break">Imêkpûñ</ins>, whence a path led off to the open water.</p>

<p>The tents are nowadays always made of cloth, either sailcloth
obtained from wrecks or drilling, which is purchased from the ships. The
latter is preferred as it makes a lighter tent and both dark blue and
white are used. Reindeer or seal skins were used for tents as lately as
1854. Elson saw tents of sealskin lined with reindeer skin at Refuge
Inlet,<a class = "tag" name = "tag160" id = "tag160" href =
"#note160">160</a> and Hooper mentions sealskin tents at Cape Smyth and
Point Barrow.<a class = "tag" name = "tag161" id = "tag161" href =

Point Barrow.<a class = "tag" name = "tag162" id = "tag162" href =
"#note162">162</a> Indeed, it is probable that canvas tents were not
common until after the great “wreck seasons” of 1871 and 1876, when so
many whaleships were lost. The Nunatañmiun at Pernyû had tents of
deerskin, and I remember also seeing one sealskin tent at the same
place, which, it is my impression, belonged to a man from Utkiavwĭñ.
Deerskin tents are used by the Anderson River natives,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag163" id = "tag163" href = "#note163">163</a> while sealskins
are still in use in Greenland and the east generally.<a class = "tag"

<p>The tents at Point Barrow are still constructed in a manner very
similar to that described by Dr. Simpson (see reference above). Four or
five poles about 12 feet long are fastened together at the top and
spread out so as to form a cone, with a base about 12 feet in diameter.
Inside of these about 6 feet from the ground is lashed a large hoop,
upon which are laid shorter poles (sometimes spears, umiak oars, etc.).
The canvas cover, which is now made in one piece, is wrapped spirally
round this
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page85" id = "page85">
85</a></span>
frame, so that the edges do not meet in front except at the top, leaving
a triangular space or doorway, filled in with a curtain of which part is
a translucent membrane, which can be covered at night with a piece of
cloth. A&nbsp;string runs from the upper corner of the cloth round the
apex of the tent and comes obliquely down the front to about the middle
of the edge of the other end of the cloth. The two edges are also held
together by a string across the entrance. Heavy articles, stones,
gravel, etc., are laid on the flap of the tent to keep it down, and
spears, paddles, etc., are laid up against the outside. (See Fig. 15,
from a photograph by Lieut. Ray.)</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 15.&mdash;Tent on the beach at
Utkiavwĭñ.</p>

<p>Inside of the tent there is much less furniture than in the iglu, as
the lamp is not needed for heating and lighting, and the cooking is done
outdoors on tripods erected over fires. The sleeping place is at the
back of the tent, and is usually marked off by laying a log across the
floor, and spreading boards on the ground. Not more than one family
usually occupy a tent. The tents at the whaling camp mentioned above
were, at first, fitted out with snow passages and fireplaces like a snow
hut, and many had a low wall of snow around them, but these had all
melted before the camp was abandoned.</p>

<p>These tents differ considerably in model from those in use in the
east, though all are made by stretching a cover over radiating poles.
For example, the tents in Greenland have the front nearly vertical,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag167" id = "tag167" href = "#note167">167</a>
while at Cumberland Gulf two sets of poles connected by a ridgepole are

people are used as habitations for women during confinement, and for
sewing rooms when they are working on deerskins in the autumn. Tents for
the latter purpose are called “su´dliwĭñ,” the place for working.</p>

<p>No. 56764 [370] (Fig. 16) will serve as a type of the water bucket
(kûtau´ɐ). A&nbsp;thin strip of spruce 8 inches wide is bent round a
circular bottom of the same wood 10¼ inches in diameter. The edge of the
latter is slightly rounded and fits into a shallow croze one-fourth inch
from the lower edge of the strip. The ends of the strip overlap 3½
inches and are sewed together with narrow strips of whalebone in two
vertical seams of short stitches, one
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page87" id = "page87">
87</a></span>
seam close to the outer end, which is steeply chamfered off and painted
red, and the other 1.6 inches from this. Both seams are countersunk in
shallow grooves on the outer part. The bucket is ornamented with a
shallow groove running round the top, and a vertical groove between the
seams. These grooves and the seam grooves are painted red. The bail is
of stout iron wire fastened on by two ears of white walrus ivory cut
into a rude outline of a whale, and secured by neat lashings of
whalebone passing through corresponding holes in the ear and the bucket.
The bucket has been some time in use.</p>

<p>No. 56763 [369] is a bucket with a bail, and very nearly of the same
shape and dimensions. It has, however, a&nbsp;bail made of rope yarns
braided together, and the ears are plain flat pieces of ivory. Buckets
of this size, with bails, are especially used for water, particularly
for bringing it from the ponds and streams. The name “kûtauɐ”
corresponds to the Greenlandic kátauaĸ, “a&nbsp;water-pail with which

<p>No. 89891 [1735] (Fig. 17), which is nearly new, is a very large tub
(ilulĭ´kpûñ, which appears to mean “a&nbsp;capacious thing”) without a
bail, and is 11 inches high and 20 in diameter. The sides are made of
two pieces of plank of equal length, whose ends overlap alternately and
are sewed together as before. The bottom is in two pieces, one large and
one small, neatly fastened together with two dowels, and is not only
held in by having its edge chamfered to fit the croze, but is pegged in
with fourteen small treenails. The seams, edges, and two ornamental
grooves around the top are painted red as before.</p>

<p>No. 89890 [1753] is smaller, 9.7 inches high and 14.5 in diameter. It
has no bail, and is ornamented with two grooves, of which the lower is
painted with black lead. The bottom is in two equal pieces, fastened
together with three dowels. This is a new tub and has the knotholes
neatly plugged with wood. There are a number of these tubs in every
house. They are known by the generic name of imusiáru (which is applied
also to a barrel, and which means literally “an unusual cup or dipper,”
small cups of the same shape being called i´musyû), but have special
names signifying their use. For instance, the little tub about 6 inches
in diameter, used by the males as a urinal, is called kúvwĭñ (“the place
for urine.”) One of these large tubs always stands to catch the drip
from the lump of snow in the house, and those of the largest size, like
No. 89891 [1735], are the kind used as chamber pots.</p>

<p>Vessels of this sort are in use throughout Alaska, and have been
observed among the eastern Eskimo where they have wood enough to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page88" id = "page88">
88</a></span>
make them. For instance, the Eskimo of the Coppermine River “form very
neat dishes of fir, the sides being made of thin deal, bent into an oval
form, secured at the ends by sewing, and fitted so nicely to the bottom
as to be perfectly water-tight.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag172" id =
"tag172" href = "#note172">172</a> There are specimens in the Museum
from the Mackenzie and Anderson Rivers, described in the MacFarlane MS.
as “pots for drinking with, pails for carrying and keeping water, and
also as chamber pots. Oil is also sometimes carried in them in
winter.”</p>

<p>In some places where wood is scarce vessels of a similar pattern are
made of whalebone. Vessels “made of whalebone, in a circular form, one
piece being bent into the proper shape for the sides,” are mentioned by
Capt. Parry on the west shore of Baffins Bay,<a class = "tag" name =

long stitches. This dish is quite old and impregnated with grease.
Vessels of this kind are uncommon, and it is probable that none have
been made since whalebone acquired its present commercial value. They
were very likely in much more general use formerly, as when there was no
such market for whalebone as at present it would be cheaper to make tubs
of this material than to buy wooden ones. In corroboration of this view
it may be noted that Dr. Simpson does not mention woodenware among the

nearly circular, with flat bottom and rounded sides. The brim is
ornamented with seven large sky-blue glass beads imbedded in it at equal
intervals, except on one side, where there is a broken notch in the
place of a bead.</p>

<p>Another, No. 89863 [1320], is larger and not flattened on the bottom,
and the brim is thinner. It is also provided with a bail of seal thong,
very neatly made, as follows: One end of the thong is knotted with a
single knot into one of the holes so as to leave one long part and one
short part (about 3 inches). The long part is then carried across and
through the other hole from the outside, back again through the first
hole and again across, so that there are three parts of thong stretched
across the bowl. The end is then tightly wrapped in a close spiral round
all the other parts, including the short end, and the wrapping is
finished off by tucking the end under the last turn. The specimen shows
the method of mending wooden dishes, boxes, etc., which have split.
A&nbsp;hole is bored on each side of the crack, and through the two is
worked a neat lashing of narrow strips of whalebone, which draws the
parts together.</p>

<p>In No. 89865 [1321], which has been split wholly across, there are
six such stitches, nearly equidistant, holding the two parts together.
This bowl is strengthened by neatly riveting a thin flat “strap” of
walrus ivory along the edge across the end of the crack. These three
bowls are of nearly the same shape, which is the common one. The new
bowl (No.&nbsp;73570 [408]) is of a less common shape, being not so
nearly hemispherical as the others, but shaped more like a common milk
pan. It is ornamented with straight lines drawn in black lead, dividing
the surface into quadrants. These were probably put on to catch the
white man’s eye, as the bowl was made for the market. Dishes of this
description are common throughout Alaska (see the National Museum
collections) and have been noted at Plover Bay.<a class = "tag" name =

<p>No. 89885-6 [1559] (Fig. 20) is sufficiently whole to show the
pattern of the first type. It is of soft gray soapstone. A&nbsp;large
angular gap is broken from the middle of one side, taking out about half
of this side, and a small angular piece from the bottom. From the corner
of this gap the pot has been broken obliquely across the bottom, and
mended in three places with stitches of whalebone made as described
under No. 89865 [1321]. One end is cut down for about half its height,
and the edge carried round in a straight line till it meets the gap in
the broken side. This end appears to have been pieced with a fresh piece
of stone, as there are holes for stitches in the edge of the whole side
and in the upper edge of the broken side. There are also two “stitch
holes” at the other side of the gap, showing how it was originally
mended. A&nbsp;low transverse ridge across the middle of the whole end
was probably an ornament. Holes for strings by which the pot was hung up
are bored one-fourth to one-half inch from the brim. Two of these are
bored obliquely through the corners, which are now broken off. The holes
in the sides close to the corners were probably made to take the place
of these. The pot is neatly and smoothly made, and the brim is slightly
rounded. It shows signs of great age, and is blackened with soot and
crusted with oil and dirt.<a class = "tag" name = "tag180" id = "tag180"

<p>No. 89883 [1097] (Fig. 21) is a small pot of a quite different shape,
best understood from the figure. Round the edge are eight holes for
strings nearly equidistant. The outside is rough, especially on the
bottom. One of the sides is much gapped, and the acute tip has been
broken off obliquely and mended with a stitch of whalebone. The care
used in mending these vessels shows that they were valuable and not
easily replaced. I&nbsp;can find no previous mention of the use of stone
vessels for cooking on the western coast, and there are no specimens in
the National Museum collections. The only Eskimo stone vessels are a
couple of small stone bowls from Bristol Bay. These are very much the
shape of the wooden bowls above described, and appear to have been used
as oil dishes and not for cooking, as the inside is crusted with grease,
while the outside is not blackened. On the other hand, stone cooking
pots are very generally employed even now by the eastern Eskimos, and
have been frequently described.<a class = "tag" name = "tag183" id =
"tag183" href = "#note183">183</a> The close resemblance of the pots

from the east, renders it very probable that the kettles were obtained
in the same way. The absence of this utensil among the southern Eskimo
of Alaska is probably due to the fact that being inhabitants of a well
wooded district they would have no need of contrivances for cooking over
a lamp.</p>

<p>I obtained three fragments of pottery, which had every appearance of
great age and were said to be pieces of a kind of cooking-pot which they
used to make “long ago, when there were no iron kettles.” The material
was said to be earth (nu´na), bear’s blood, and feathers,<a class =

appears to have been tall and cylindrical, perhaps shaped like a
bean-pot, pretty smooth inside, and coated with dried oil or blood,
black from age. The outside is rather rough, and marked with faint
rounded transverse ridges, as if a large cord had been wound round the
vessel while still soft. The largest shard has been broken obliquely
across and mended with two stitches of sinew, and all are very old and
black.</p>

<p>Beechey (Voyage, p. 295) speaks of “earthen jars for cooking” at
Hotham Inlet in 1826 and 1827, and Mr. E.&nbsp;W. Nelson has collected a
few jars from the Norton Sound region, very like what those used at
Point Barrow must have been. Choris figures a similar vessel in his
Voyage Pittoresque, Pl. <span class = "smallroman">III</span> (2d), Fig.
2, from Kotzebue Sound. Metal kettles of various sorts are now
exclusively used for cooking, and are called by the same name as the old
soapstone vessels, which it will be observed corresponds to the name
used by the eastern Eskimo. Light sheet-iron camp-kettles are eagerly
purchased and they are very glad to get any kind of small tin cans, such
as preserved meat tins, which
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page93" id = "page93">

they use for holding water, etc., and sometimes fit with bails of string
or wire, so as to use them for cooking porridge, etc., over the lamp.

<p>In preparing food it is often desirable to break the large bones of
the meat, both to obtain the marrow and to facilitate the trying out of
the fat for making the pemmican already described. Deer bones are
crushed into a sort of coarse bone-meal for feeding the dogs when
traveling. For this purpose heavy short-handled stone mauls are used.
These tools may have been formerly serviceable as hammers for driving
treenails, etc., as the first specimen obtained was described as
“savik-pidjûk-nunamisinĭ´ktuɐ-kau´teɐ” (literally
“iron-not-dead-hammer”), or the hammer used by those now dead, who had
no iron. For this purpose, however, they are wholly superseded by iron
hammers, and are now only used for bone crushers. The collection
contains a large series of these implements, namely, 13 complete mauls
and 13 unhafted heads. All are constructed on the same general plan,
consisting of an oblong roughly cylindrical mass of stone, with flat
ends, mounted on the expanded end of a short haft, which is applied to
the middle of one side of the cylinder and is slightly curved, like the
handle of an adz. Such a haft is frequently made of the “branch” of a
reindeer antler, and the expanded end is made by cutting off a portion
of the “beam” where the branch joins it. A&nbsp;haft so made is
naturally elliptical and slightly curved at right angles to the longer
diameter of the ellipse, and is applied to the head so that the greatest
thickness and therefore the greatest strength comes in the line of the
blow, as in a civilized ax or hammer. The head and haft are held
together by a lashing of thong or three-ply braid of sinew, passing
through a large hole in the large end of the haft and round the head.
This lashing is put on wet and dries hard and tight.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag188" id = "tag188" href = "#note188">188</a> It follows the
same general plan in all the specimens, though no two are exactly alike.
The material of the heads, with three exceptions (No.&nbsp;56631 [222],
gray porphyry; No. 89654 [906], black quartzite, and No. 89655 [1241],
coarse-grained gray syenite), is massive pectolite (see above, <a href =
"#page60">p.&nbsp;60</a>), generally of a pale greenish or bluish gray
color and slightly translucent, sometimes dark and opaque. No. 56635
[243] will serve as the type of these implements.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag189" id = "tag189" href = "#note189">189</a></p>

<p>The head is of light bluish gray pectolite, and is lashed with a
three-ply braid of reindeer sinew to a haft of some soft coniferous
wood, probably spruce, rather smoothly whittled out and soiled by
handling. The transverse ridge on the under side of the butt is to keep
the hand from slipping off the grip. The whole is dirty and shows signs
of considerable age.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page94" id = "page94">
94</a></span>
<p>These mauls vary considerable in size. The largest is 7.1 inches long
and 2.5 in diameter, and the smallest 2.1 inches long by 2.4. This is a
very small hammer, No. 56634 [83] having a haft only 4.7 inches long.
The haft is usually about 5 inches long. The longest (belonging to one
of the smaller heads, 4&nbsp;inches by&nbsp;2) is 7.2 inches long, and
the shortest (belonging to a slightly larger head, 4.7 by 3.1 inches) is
4.5 inches. The largest two heads, each 7.1 by 2.5 inches, have hafts 5
inches long.</p>

<p>The lashing of all is put on in the same general way, namely, by
securing one end round the head and through the eye, then taking a
variable number of turns round the head and through the hole, and
tightening these up by wrapping the end spirally round all the parts,
where they stretch from head to haft on each side. Seal thong, narrow or
broad, is more generally used than sinew braid (only three specimens out
of the thirteen have lashings of sinew). When broad thong is used the
loop is made by splicing, as follows: A&nbsp;slit is cut about 1½ inches
from the end of the thong, and the end is doubled in a bight and passed
through this slit. The end is then slit and the other end of the thong
passed through it and drawn taut, making a splice which holds all the
tighter for drawing on it. A&nbsp;simple loop is tied in sinew
braid.</p>

<p>The following figures will illustrate the most important variations
in the form of this implement. Fig. 23, No. 56634 [83] from Utkiavwĭñ,
has a head of light gray pectolite, slightly translucent, and evidently
ground flat on the faces, and the haft is of reindeer antler, with a
slight knob at the butt. A&nbsp;square piece of buckskin is doubled and
inserted between the head and haft. The lashing is of fine sealskin
twine, and the spiral wrapping is carried wholly round the head. This
was the first stone maul collected, and was put together at the station,
as mentioned above. It is rather smaller than usual. Fig. 24, No. 56637
[196], from Utkiavwĭñ, has the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page95" id = "page95">
95</a></span>
head of grayish pectolite, rough and unusually large. The haft is of
some soft coniferous wood soaked with grease. It is nearly round,
instead of elliptical, with an irregular knob at the butt, and not
curved, but fastened obliquely to the head. The loop of double thong
attached to the haft is probably to go round the wrist.</p>

<p>Fig. 25, No. 56639 [161], from Utkiavwĭñ, is of pectolite, the upper
and lower faces almost black and the sides light gray. The haft is of
hard wood and unusually long (7.2 inches). It is noticeable for being
attached at right angles to the head, by a very stout lashing of thong
of the usual kind, and further tightened by a short flat stick wedged in
below the head on one side. There appears to have been a similar “key”
on the other side. This is an unusual form.</p>

<p>Fig. 27, No. 89655 [1241], from Utkiavwĭñ. The head of this maul is a
long pebble of rather coarse-grained gray syenite, and is peculiar in
having a shallow groove roughly worked out round the middle to keep the
lashing from slipping. It is 4.7 inches long and 3.1 in diameter. The
haft is of reindeer antler 4.5 inches long, and the lashing of seal
thong peculiar only in the large number of turns in the spiral
wrappings.</p>

<p>Fig. 28, No. 89657 [877], from Nuwŭk. This is peculiar in having the
haft fitted into a deep angular groove on one side of the head, which is
of pectolite and otherwise of the common pattern. The haft of reindeer
antler and the lashing of broad thong are evidently newer than the head
and are clumsily made and put on, the latter making several turns about
one side of the haft as well as through it and round the head.</p>

<p>None of the unmounted heads, which are all of pectolite, are grooved
in this way to receive the haft, but No. 56658 [205] has two shallow,
incomplete grooves round the middle for lashings, and No. 56655 [218],
which is nearly square in section, has shallow notches on the edges for
the same purpose. One specimen of the series comes from Sidaru, but
differs in no way from specimens from the northern villages.</p>

<p>Stone mauls of this type have previously been seldom found among the
American Eskimo. The only specimens in the Museum from America are two
small unhafted maul heads of pectolite, one from Hotham Inlet and the
other from Cape Nome, and a roughly made maul from Norton Sound, all
collected by Mr. Nelson. The last is an oblong piece of dark-colored
jade rudely lashed to the end of a short thick stick, which has a
lateral projection round which the lashing passes instead of through a
hole in the haft. Among the “Chukches” at Pithkaj, however, Nordenskiöld
found stone mauls of precisely the same model as ours and also used as
bone crushers. He observed that the natives themselves ate the crushed
bone after boiling it with blood and water.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag190" id = "tag190" href = "#note190">190</a> Lieut. Ray saw only
dogs fed with it in the interior. Nordenskiöld does not mention
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page97" id = "page97">
97</a></span>
the kind of stone used for these tools, but the two in the National
Museum, collected by Mr. Nelson at Cape Wankarem, are both of granite or
syenite and have a groove for the lashing. (Compare No. 89655 [1241],
fig.&nbsp;27.)</p>

<p>In addition to the above-described stone mauls, there are in the
collection five nearly similar mauls of heavy bone, which have evidently
served the same purpose. They were all brought over for sale from
Utkiavwĭñ at about the same time, and from their exceedingly oily
condition were evidently brought to light in rummaging round in the old
“blubber-rooms,” where they have long lain forgotten. Four of these
differ in no respect from the stone mauls except in having the heads
made of whale’s rib; the fifth is all in one piece.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 30.&mdash;Bone maul.</p>

<p>The following figures will illustrate the general form of these
implements: Fig. 29, No. 89847 [1046]: The head is a section of a small
rib, 4.8 inches long, and has a deep notch on each side to receive the
lashing. The haft is probably of spruce (it&nbsp;is so impregnated with
grease that it
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page98" id = "page98">
98</a></span>
is impossible to be sure about&nbsp;it), and is rough and somewhat
knobby, with a rounded knob on the butt and two shallow finger notches
on the under side of the grip. It is attached by a lashing of stout
thong of the ordinary pattern. Fig. 30, No. 89849 [1047]: The head is a
straight four-sided block of whale’s rib, 6&nbsp;inches long. The deep
notches for the lashing, one on each side, are 1 inch behind the middle.
The haft is a roughly whittled knotty piece of spruce, and instead of a
knob has a thick flange on the lower side of the butt. The lashing is of
fourteen or fifteen turns of seal twine, and keyed upon each side by a
roughly split stick thrust in under the head. Fig. 31, No. 89846 [1048]:
This is peculiar in having the haft not attached at or near the middle
of the head, but at one end, which is shouldered to receive it. The haft
is of the common pattern and attached as usual, the lashing being made
of very stout sinew braid. The head is a section of a small rib 6 inches
long. Fig. 32, No. 89845 [1049]: This is made in one piece, and roughly
carved with broad cuts from a piece of whale’s jaw. The grooves and
holes in the bone are the natural canals of blood vessels. All these
mauls are battered on the striking face, showing that they have been
used.</p>

<p>At the first glance it seems as if we had here a series illustrating
the development of the stone hammer. Fig. 32 would be the first form,
while
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page99" id = "page99">
99</a></span>
the next step would be to increase the weight of the head by lashing a
large piece of bone to the end of the haft, instead of carving the whole
laboriously out of a larger piece of bone. The substitution of the still
heavier stone for the bone would obviously suggest itself next. The weak
point in this argument, however, is that the advantage of the transition
from the first to the next form is not sufficiently obvious. It seems to
me more natural to suppose that the hafted stone hammer has been
developed here, as is believed to have been the case elsewhere, by
simply adding a handle to the pebble which had already been used as a
hammer without one. These bone implements are then to be considered as
makeshifts or substitutes for the stone hammer, when stones suitable for
making the latter could not be procured. Now, such stones are rare at
Point Barrow, and must be brought from a distance or purchased from
other natives; hence the occasional use of such makeshifts as these.
This view will account for the rarity of these bone hammers, as well as
the rudeness of their construction. No. 89845 [1049] would thus be
merely the result of individual fancy and not a link in the chain of
development.</p>

<p>Cooked food is generally served in large shallow trays more or less
neatly carved from driftwood and nearly circular or oblong in shape. The
collection contains two specimens of the circular form and three oblong
ones. All but one of these have been long in use and are very greasy.
No. 73576 [392] (Fig.&nbsp;33) has been selected as the type of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page100" id = "page100">

circular dishes (i´libiɐ). This is very smoothly carved from a single
piece of pine wood. The brim is rounded, with a large rounded gap in one
side, where a piece has probably been broken out. The brim is slightly
cracked and chipped. The vessel is very greasy and shows marks inside
where meat has been cut up in it. No. 89867 [1323] is a very similar
dish, and made of the same material, but elliptical instead of circular,
and larger, being 22.5 inches long, 15.5 broad, and 2.1 deep. It has
been split in two, and mended with whalebone stitches in the manner
previously described.</p>

<p>No. 73575 [223] (Fig. 34) is a typical oblong dish. It is neatly
hollowed out, having a broad margin painted with red ocher. It measures
24 inches in length, is made of pine, rather roughly carved on the
outside, and is new and clean. This is a common form of dish. Fig. 35,
No. 89868 [1377], is an old tray of an unusual form. It is rudely hewn
out of a straight piece of plank, 34.8 inches long, showing inside and
out the marks of a dull adz, called by the seller “kau´dlo tu´mai,” “the
footprints of the stone (scil. adz).” The excavation is shallow and
leaves a margin of 2 inches at one end, and the outside is roughly
beveled off at the sides and ends. The holes near the ends were
evidently for handles of thong. The material is spruce, discolored and
somewhat greasy. Fig. 36, No. 89866 [1376], was said by the native who
brought it over for sale to be especially intended for fish. It is much
the shape of No. 73575 [223], but broader, slightly deeper, and more
curved. The brim is narrow and rounded and the bottom smoothly rounded
off. It measures 23.3 inches in length, and is made of pine. It has been
deeply split in two places and stitched together with whalebone

(<i>I´musyû</i>).&mdash;</h6>

<p>One of the commonest forms of drinking vessels is a little tub of
whalebone of precisely the same shape as the large whalebone dish
described above (<a href = "#page88">p.&nbsp;88</a>). Of these there are
five specimens in the collection, all from Utkiavwĭñ. No. 89853 [1302]
(Fig.&nbsp;37) will serve as the type. It is 4.6 inches long and made by
binding a strip of black whalebone round a spruce bottom, and sewing
together the ends, which overlap each other about 1½ inches, with coarse
strips of whalebone.</p>

<p>There are two vertical seams three-fourths inch apart. The bottom is
held in by fitting its slightly chamfered edge into a shallow croze cut
in the whalebone. All these cups are made almost exactly alike, and
nearly of the same size, varying only a fraction of an inch in height,
and from 4.2 to 5.5 inches in length. The only variation is in the
distance the ends overlap and the number of stitches in the seams. Such
cups are to be found in nearly every house, and one is generally kept
conveniently near the water bucket. Though the pattern is an ancient
one, they are still manufactured. No. 56560 [654] was found among the
débris of one of the ruined houses at Utkiavwĭñ, and differs from the
modern cups only in having the ends sewed together with one seam instead
of two, while No. 89851 [1300], though it has been in actual use, was
made after our arrival, as the bottom is made of a piece of one of our
cigar boxes.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Dippers of horn are in very general use for drinking water. These are
all of essentially the same shape, and are made of the light yellow
translucent horn of the mountain sheep. There are three specimens in our
collection, of which No. 56534 [28] (Fig.&nbsp;38) has been selected as
the type. This is made of a single piece of pale yellow translucent
horn,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page102" id = "page102">
102</a></span>
apparently softened and molded into shape, cut only on the edges and the
handle. A&nbsp;stout peg of antler is driven through the handle,
1&nbsp;inch from the tip, and projects behind, serving as a hook by
which to hang the dipper on the edge of a bucket. The other two are
similar in shape and size, but No. 89831 [1293] has no peg, and has one
side of the handle cut into a series of slight notches to keep the hand
from slipping, while No. 89832 [1577] is rather straighter and has a
smaller, shallower bowl, and the grip of the handle roughened with
transverse grooves. Fig. 39, No. 89739 [774|, is a horn dipper, but one
that is very old and of a pattern no longer in use. The bowl, which is
much broken and gapped, is oval and deep, with a thick handle at one
end, running out in the line of the axis of the bowl. This handle, which
is the thick part of the horn, near the tip, is flat above, rounded
below, and has its tip slightly rounded, apparently by a stone tool.
Just where the bowl and handle meet there is a deep transverse saw-cut,
made to facilitate bending the handle into its place. The material is
horn, apparently of the mountain sheep, turned brown by age and
exposure. The specimen had been long lying neglected round the village
of Utkiavwĭñ.</p>

<p>Horn dippers of the same general pattern as these are common
throughout Alaska. The Museum collection contains a large series of such
utensils, collected by Mr. Nelson and others. The cups and dippers of
musk-ox horn found by Parry at Iglulik are somewhat different in
shape.<a class = "tag" name = "tag193" id = "tag193" href =
"#note193">193</a> Those made of the enlarged base of horn<a class =
"tag" name = "tag194" id = "tag194" href = "#note194">194</a> have a
short handle and a nearly square bowl, while the hollow top of the horn
is used for a cup without alteration beyond sometimes bending up the
end, which serves as a handle.<a class = "tag" name = "tag195" id =
"tag195" href = "#note195">195</a> Curiously enough, cups of this last
pattern appear not to be found anywhere else except at Plover Bay,
eastern Siberia, where very similar vessels (as&nbsp;shown by the Museum
collections) are made from the horn of the Siberian mountain sheep. An
unusual form of dipper is beautifully made of fossil ivory. Such cups
are rare and highly prized. We saw only three, one from each village,
Nuwŭk, Utkiavwĭñ, and Sidaru, and all were obtained for the collection.
They show signs of age and long use. They differ somewhat in shape and
size, but each is carved from a single piece of ivory and has a large
bowl and a straight handle. No. 56535 [371] (Fig.&nbsp;40), which will
serve as the type of the ivory dipper (i´musyû, kĭlĭgwû´garo), is neatly
carved from a single piece of fine-grained fossil ivory, yellowed by
age. The handle, polished by long use, terminates in a blunt, recurved,
tapering hook, which serves the purpose of the peg in the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page103" id = "page103">
103</a></span>
horn dipper. The rounded gap in the brim opposite the handle is an
accidental break. Another, No. 89830 [1259], from Sidaru, is a long
trough-like cup, with rounded ends and a short flat handle at one end,
made of a short transverse section of a rather small tusk, keeping the
natural roundness of the tusk, but cut off flat on top and excavated.
A&nbsp;wooden peg, like those in the horn dippers, is inserted in the
end of the handle. This cup is especially interesting from its
resemblance to the one obtained by Beechey (Voyage, Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">I</span>, Fig.&nbsp;4) at Eschscholtz Bay, from which it
differs only in being about 2 inches shorter and deeper in proportion.
Thomas Simpson speaks of obtaining an ivory cup from some Point Barrow
natives at Dease Inlet exactly like the one figured by Beechey, but with
the handle broken off.<a class = "tag" name = "tag196" id = "tag196"
href = "#note196">196</a> Fig. 41, No. 89833 [933], from Nuwŭk, has a
large bowl, nearly circular, with a broad, straight handle and a broad
hook. The part of the bowl to which the handle is attached,
a&nbsp;semicircular piece 3 inches long and 1¾ wide, has been split out
with the grain of the tusk, and mended with three stitches, in this case
of sinew, in the usual manner. There was an old gap in the brim opposite
to the handle, and the edges of it have been freshly and roughly
whittled down. The ornamentation of the outside and handle, consisting
of narrow incised lines and small circles, each with a dot in the
center, is well shown in the figure. These engravings were originally
colored with red ocher, but are now filled with dirt and are nearly
effaced by wear on the handle. This dipper is not of such fine quality
of ivory as the other two. It is not unlikely that all these vessels
were made by the natives around Kotzebue Sound, where ivory is plenty,
and where Beechey, as quoted above, found one so like one of ours. We
were informed by the owner that No. 56535 [371] was obtained from the
Nunatañmiun.</p>

ladles.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>Each family has several spoons of various sizes, and narrow shallow
ladles of horn, bone, etc. The large spoon is for stirring and ladling
soup, etc. There is only one specimen in the collection, No. 89739
[1352] (Fig.&nbsp;42). This is a new one, made by a native of Utkiavwĭñ,
whom I asked to make himself a new spoon and bring me his old one. He,
however, misunderstood me and brought over the new one, which Lieut. Ray
purchased, not knowing that I had especially asked for the old one.
These spoons seem to be in such constant use that the natives did not
offer them for sale. This specimen is smoothly carved from a single
piece of pine, and painted all over, except the inside of the bowl, with
red ocher. A&nbsp;cross of red ocher is marked in the middle of the
bowl, and there is a shallow groove, colored with blacklead, along the
middle of the handle on top. The length is 13.2 inches. A&nbsp;small
spoon of light-colored horn, No. 89416 [1379], has a bowl of the common
spoon shape with a short, flat handle. Spoons of this sort were not seen
in use, and as this is new and evidently made for sale it may be meant
for a copy of one of our spoons. The narrow ladles of horn or bone may
formerly have been used for eating before it was so easy to get tin
pots, but at present are chiefly used for dipping oil, especially for
filling the lamp. The collection contains one of horn and four of
bone.</p>

<p>No. 89415 [1070], Fig. 43, is made of a single piece of
mountain-sheep horn, dark brown from age and use, softened and molded
into shape. It is impregnated with oil, showing that it has been long in
use. This utensil closely resembles a great number of specimens in the
Museum from the more southern parts of Alaska. No. 89411 [1294]
(Fig.&nbsp;44) is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page105" id = "page105">
105</a></span>
a typical bone ladle. The material is rather coarse-grained, compact
bone from a whale’s rib or jawbone. No. 89414 [1013] closely resembles
this but is a trifle larger. The other two specimens are interesting as
showing an attempt at ornamentation. No. 89412 [1102] (Fig. 45, from
Nuwŭk) is carved smoothly into a rude, flattened figure of a whale
(Balaena mysticetus). The flukes form the handle and the belly is
hollowed out into the bowl of the ladle. No. 89413 [934] (Fig. 46, from
Utkiavwĭñ) has the handle carved into a rude bear’s head, which has the
eyes, nostrils, and outline of the mouth incised and filled in with dark
oil dregs. All these ladles have the curved side of the bowl on the
left, showing that they were meant to be used with the right hand. The
name, kĭliu´tɐ, obtained for these ladles is given in the vocabulary
collected by Dr. Oldmixon as “scraper,” which seems to be the
etymological meaning of the word. These implements may be used for
scraping blubber from skins, or the name may correspond in meaning to
the cognate Greenlandic kiliortût, “a&nbsp;scraper; especially a mussel
shell (a&nbsp;natural scraper).” The resemblance of these ladles to a
mussel shell is sufficiently apparent for the name to be applied to
them. Indeed, they may have been made in imitation of mussel shells,
which the Eskimo, in all probability, like so many other savages, used
for ladles as well as scrapers.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the stone lamps or oil-burners used
for lighting and warming the houses, which, in Dr. Simpson’s time, were
obtained by trading from the “Kûñmû´dlĭñ,” who in turn procured them
from other Eskimo far to the east. These are flat, shallow dishes,
usually like a gibbous moon in outline, and are of two sizes: the larger
house lamp, 18 inches to 3 feet in length, and the small traveling lamp,
6&nbsp;or 8 inches long. The latter is used in the temporary snow huts
when a halt is made at night. In each house are usually two lamps, one
standing at each side, with the curved side against the wall, and raised
by blocks a few inches from the floor. In one large house, that of old
Yûksĭ´ña, the so-called “chief,” at Nuwŭk,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page106" id = "page106">
106</a></span>
there were three lamps, the third standing in the right-hand front
corner of the house. The dish is filled with oil, which is burned by
means of a wick of moss fibers arranged along the outer edge. Large
lamps are usually divided into three compartments, of which the middle
is the largest, by wooden partitions called sä´potĭn (corresponding to
the Greenlandic saputit, “(1)&nbsp;a&nbsp;dam across a stream for
catching fish, (2)&nbsp;a&nbsp;dam or dike in general”), along which
wicks can also be arranged. The women tend the lamps with great care,
trimming and arranging the wick with little sticks. The lamp burns with
scarcely any smoke and a bright flame, the size of which is regulated by
kindling more or less of the wick, and is usually kept filled by the
drip from a lump of blubber stuck on a sharp stick (ajû´ksûxbwĭñ)
projecting from the wall about a foot above the middle of the lamp.<a

which the man of the house uses to light his pipe with when sitting on
the banquette, without the trouble of getting down, by dipping the end

for trimming the wick also serve as pipe-lighters and for carrying fire

enable one to read and write with ease when sitting on the banquette,

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 48.&mdash;Sandstone lamp.</p>

<p>Fig. 47 (No. 89879) [872] is a typical house lamp, though rather a
small specimen. It is carved out of soft gray soapstone and is 17 inches
long. The back is nearly vertical, while the front flares strongly
outward. The back wall is cut down vertically inside with a narrow
rounded brim and the front curves gradually in from the very edge to the
bottom of the cavity, which is 1½ inches deep in the middle. The
posterior third of the cavity is occupied by a flat, straight shelf with
a sloping edge about 0.7 inch high. About a third of one end of the lamp
has been broken off obliquely and mended, as usual, with stitches. There
are two of these neatly countersunk in channels. The specimen has been
long in use and is thoroughly incrusted with oil and soot. No. 89880
[1731] (Fig.&nbsp;48) is peculiar, from the material of which it is
made. This is a coarse, gritty stone, rather soft, but much more
difficult to work than the soapstone. It is rudely worked into something
the same shape as the type, but has the cavity but slightly hollowed
out, without a shelf, and only a little steeper behind than in front.
The idea at once suggests itself that this lamp, which is very old and
sooty, was made at Point Barrow and was an attempt to imitate the
imported lamps with stone obtained from the beds reported by Lieut. Ray
in Kulugrua. There is, of course, no means of proving this supposition.
There is no mention of any material except soapstone being made into
lamps by the Greenlanders or other eastern Eskimo, but the lamps from
Kadiak and Bristol Bay in the National Museum are made of some hard gray
stone.</p>

<p>Suitable material is not at hand for the proper comparison of the
lamps used by the different branches of the Eskimo race. All travelers
who have written about the Eskimo speak of the use of such lamps, which
agree in being shallow, oblong dishes of stone. Dr. Bessels<a class =
"tag" name = "tag199" id = "tag199" href = "#note199">199</a> figures a
lamp of soapstone from Ita, Smith Sound, closely resembling No. 89880,
and a little lamp in the Museum from Greenland is of essentially the
same shape, but deeper. The same form appears at Hudson Strait in the
lamps collected by Mr. L.&nbsp;M. Turner, while those used at Iglulik
are nearly semicircular.<a class = "tag" name = "tag200" id = "tag200"
href = "#note200">200</a> South of Kotzebue Sound lamps of the shape so
common in the east are used, but these, Mr. Turner informs me, are never
made of soapstone, but always of sandstone, shale, etc. The people of
Kadiak and the Aleuts anciently used lamps of hard stone, generally oval
in shape, and sometimes made by slightly hollowing out one side of a
large round pebble.<a class = "tag" name = "tag201" id = "tag201" href =
"#note201">201</a> Such a rough lamp was brought by Lieut. Stoney,
U.S.&nbsp;Navy, from Kotzebue Sound. No such highly finished and
elaborate lamps as the large house lamps at Point Barrow are mentioned
except by Nordenskiöld, who figures one from Siberia.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag202" id = "tag202" href = "#note202">202</a> This lamp is
interesting as the only one described with a ledge comparable to the
shelf of No. 89879. Lamps from the region between Point Barrow and
Boothia Felix are especially needed to elucidate the distribution and
development of this utensil. The rudely hollowed pebble
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page109" id = "page109">
109</a></span>
of the ancient Aleut and the elaborate lamp of the Point Barrow Eskimo
are evidently the two extremes of the series of forms, but the
intermediate patterns are still to be described.</p>

<p>Fig. 50, No. 56492 [108], is a peculiar article of which only one
specimen was collected. We were given to understand at the time of
purchasing it that it was a sort of socket or escutcheon to be fastened
to the wall above a lamp to hold the blubber stick described above. No
such escutcheons, however, were seen in use in the houses visited. The
article is evidently old. It is a flat piece of thick plank of some soft
wood, 11.4 inches long, 4.2 broad, and about 1½ thick, very rudely
carved into a human head and body without arms, with a large round hole
about 1¼ inches in diameter through the middle of the breast. The eyes
and mouth are incised, and the nose was in relief, but was long ago
split off. There is a deep furrow all around the head, perhaps for
fastening on a hood.</p>

<p>The clothing of these people is as a rule made entirely of skins,
though of late years drilling and calico are used for some parts of the
dress which will be afterwards described. Petroff<a class = "tag" name =
"tag203" id = "tag203" href = "#note203">203</a> makes the rather
surprising statement that “a&nbsp;large amount of ready-made clothing
finds its way into the hands of these people, who wear it in summer, but
the excessive cold of winter compels them to resume the fur garments
formerly in general use among them.” Fur garments are in as general use
at Point Barrow as they ever were, and the cast-off clothing obtained
from the ships is mostly packed away in some corner of the iglu. We
landed at Cape Smyth not long after the wreck of the <i>Daniel
Webster</i>, whose crew had abandoned and given away a great deal of
their clothing. During that autumn a good many men and boys wore white
men’s coats or shirts in place of the outer frock, especially when
working or lounging about the station, but by the next spring these were
all packed away and were not resumed again except in rare instances in
the summer.</p>

<p>The chief material is the skin of the reindeer, which is used in
various stages of pelage. Fine, short-haired summer skins, especially
those of does and fawns, are used for making dress garments and
underclothes. The heavier skins are used for everyday working clothes,
while the heaviest winter skins furnish extra warm jackets for cold
weather, warm winter stockings and mittens. The white or spotted skins
of the tame Siberian reindeer, obtained from the “Nunatañmiun,” are
especially valued for full-dress jackets. We heard no mention of the use
of the skin of the unborn reindeer fawn, but there is a kind of dark
deerskin used only for edgings, which appears to be that of an
exceedingly young deer. This skin is extremely thin, and the hair so
short that it is almost invisible. Siberian deerskins can always be
recognized by

having the flesh side colored red,<a class = "tag" name = "tag204" id =

<p>The skins of the white mountain sheep, white and blue fox, wolf, dog,
ermine, and lynx are sometimes used for clothing, and under jackets made
of eider duck skins are rarely used. Sealskin dressed with the hair on
is used only for breeches and boots, and for those rarely. Black dressed
sealskin&mdash;that is, with the epidermis left on and the hair shaved
off&mdash;is used for waterproof boots, while the white sealskin, tanned
in urine, with the epidermis removed, is used for the soles of winter
boots. Waterproof boot soles are made of oil-dressed skins of the white
whale, bearded seal, walrus, or polar bear. The last material is not
usually mentioned as serving for sole leather among the Eskimo.
Nordenskiöld,<a class = "tag" name = "tag205" id = "tag205" href =
"#note205">205</a> however, found it in use among the Chukches for this
purpose. It is considered an excellent material for soles at Point
Barrow, and is sometimes used to make boat covers, which are beautifully
white. Heavy mittens for the winter are made of the fur of the polar
bear or of dogskin. Waterproof outer frocks are of seal entrails, split
and dried and sewed together. For trimmings are used deerskin of
different colors, mountain-sheep skin, and black and white sealskin,
wolf, wolverine, and marten fur, and whole ermine skins, as well as red
worsted, and occasionally beads.</p>


<h5><a name = "clothing_style" id = "clothing_style" href =

<p>Dr. Simpson<a class = "tag" name = "tag206" id = "tag206" href =
"#note206">206</a> gave an excellent general description of the dress of
these people, which is the same at the present day. While the same in
general pattern as that worn by all other Eskimo, it differs in many
details from that worn by the eastern Eskimo,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag207" id = "tag207" href = "#note207">207</a> and most closely
resembles the style in vogue at and near Norton Sound.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag208" id = "tag208" href = "#note208">208</a> The man’s dress
(Fig. 51, from a photograph of Apaidyao) consists of the usual loose
hooded frock, without opening except at the neck and wrists. This
reaches just over the hips, rarely about to mid-thigh, where it is cut
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page111" id = "page111">
111</a></span>
off square, and is usually confined by a girdle at the waist. Under this
garment is worn a similar one, usually of lighter skin and sometimes
without a hood. The thighs are clad in one or two pairs of tight-fitting
knee breeches, confined round the hips by a girdle and usually secured
by a drawstring below the knee which ties over the tops of the boots. On
the legs and feet are worn, first, a&nbsp;pair of long, deerskin
stockings with the hair inside; then slippers of tanned sealskin, in the
bottom of which is spread a layer of whalebone shavings, and outside a
pair of close-fitting boots, held in place by a string round the ankle,
usually reaching above the knee and ending with a rough edge, which is
covered by the breeches. Dress boots often end with an ornamental border
and a drawstring just below the knee. The boots are of reindeer skin,
with white sealskin soles for winter and dry weather, but in summer
waterproof boots of black sealskin with soles of white whale skin, etc.,
are worn. Overshoes of the same material, reaching just above the
ankles, with a drawstring at the top and ankle strings, are sometimes
worn over the winter boots. When traveling on snowshoes or in soft dry
snow the boots are replaced by stockings of the same shape as the under
ones, but made of very thick winter deerskins with the flesh side
out.</p>

<p>Instead of breeches and boots a man occasionally wears a pair of
pantaloons or tight-fitting trousers terminating in shoes such as are
worn by the women. Over the usual dress is worn in very cold weather a
circular mantle of deerskin, fastened by a thong at the neck&mdash;such
mantles are nowadays occasionally made of blankets&mdash;and in rainy
weather both sexes wear the hooded rain frock of seal gut. Of late years
both sexes have adopted the habit of wearing over their clothes a loose
hoodless frock of cotton cloth, usually bright-colored calico,
especially in blustering weather, when it is useful in keeping the
drifting snow out of their furs.</p>

<p>Both men and women wear gloves or mittens. These are of deerskin for
ordinary use, but in extreme weather mittens of polar bear skin are
worn. When hunting in winter it is the custom to wear gloves of thin
deerskin under the bearskin mitten, so that the rifle can be handled
without touching the bare hand to the cold iron. The women have a common
trick of wearing only one mitten, but keeping the other arm withdrawn
from the sleeve and inside of the jacket.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 52.&mdash;Woman’s hood.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The dress of the women consists of two frocks, which differ from
those of the men in being continued from the waist in two rather full
rounded skirts at the front and back, reaching to or below the knee.
A&nbsp;woman’s frock is always distinguished by a sort of rounded bulge
or pocket at the nape of the neck (see Fig. 52, from a sketch by the
writer), which is intended to receive the head of the infant when
carried in the jacket. The little peak at the top of the hood is also
characteristic of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page112" id = "page112">
112</a></span>
woman’s frock. On her legs a woman wears a pair of tight-fitting
deerskin pantaloons with the hair next the skin, and outside of these a
similar pair made of the skins of deer legs, with the hair out, and
having soles of sealskin, but no anklestrings. The outer pantaloons are
usually laid aside in spring, and waterproof boots like the men’s, but
fastened below the knee with drawstrings, are worn over the under
pantaloons. In the summer pantaloons wholly of waterproof sealskin are
often put on. The women’s pantaloons, like the men’s breeches, are
fastened with a girdle just above the hips. It appears that they do not
stay up very well, as the women are continually “hitching” them up and
tightening their girdles.</p>

<p>Until they reach manhood the boys wear pantaloons like the women, but
their jackets are cut just like those of the men. The dress of the girls
is a complete miniature of that of the women, even to the pocket for the
child’s head. Those who are well-to-do generally own several complete
suits of clothes, and present a neat appearance when not engaged in
dirty work. The poorer ones wear one suit on all occasions till it
becomes shabby. New clothes are seldom put on till winter.</p>

<p>The outer frock is not often worn in the iglu, being usually taken
off before entering the room, and the under one is generally dispensed
with. Men habitually leave off their boots in the house, and rarely
their stockings and breeches, retaining only a pair of thin deerskin
drawers. This custom of stripping in the house has been noticed among
all Eskimos whose habits have been described, from Greenland to Siberia.
The natives are slow to adopt any modifications in the style of dress,
the excellence and convenience of which has been so frequently commented
upon that it is unnecessary to refer to it. One or two youths learned
from association with us the convenience of pockets, and accordingly had
“patch pockets” of cloth sewed on the outside of the skirt of the inner
frock, and one young man in 1883 wore a pair of sealskin hip boots,
evidently copies from our india-rubber wading boots. I&nbsp;now proceed
to the description of the clothing in detail.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "clothing_style_head" id =
"clothing_style_head" href = "#clothing_style">Head
clothing.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>The only head covering usually worn is the hood of the frock, which
reaches to about the middle of the head, the front being covered by the
hair. Women who are carrying children in the jacket sometimes wrap the
head in a cloth. (I&nbsp;have an indistinct recollection of once seeing
a woman with a deerskin hood, but was too busy at the time to make a
note or sketch of&nbsp;it.) One man at Utkiavwĭñ (Nägawau´ra, now
deceased), who was quite bald on the forehead, used to protect the front
of his head with a sort of false front of deerskin, tied round like a
fillet. No specimens of any of these articles were obtained. Fancy
conical caps are worn in the dances and theatrical performances, but
these belong more properly under the head of Games and Pastimes (where
they will be described) than under that of Clothing.</p>

<p>Two frocks are always worn by both sexes except in the house, or in
warm weather, the inner (ílupa) with the hair next the skin, and the
outer (kalûru´rɐ) with the hair out. The outer frock is also sometimes
worn with the hair in, especially when it is new and the flesh side
clean and white. This side is often ornamented with little tufts of
marten fur and stripes of red ocher. The difference in shape between the
frocks of the two sexes has been already mentioned. The man’s frock is a
loose shirt, not fitted to the body, widening at the bottom, and
reaching, when unbelted, just below the hips. The skirts are cut off
square or slightly rounded, and are a little longer behind than in
front. The hood is rounded, loose around the neck, and fitted in more on
the sides than on the nape. The front edge of the hood, when drawn up,
comes a little forward of the top of the head and runs round under the
chin, covering the ears.</p>

<p>There are in the collection three specimens, all rather elaborate
dress frocks, to be worn outside. All have been worn. No. 56751 [184]
(Fig.&nbsp;53), brown deerskin, will serve as the type. The pattern can
best be explained by reference to the accompanying diagrams
(Fig.&nbsp;54). The body consists of two pieces, front and back, each
made of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page114" id = "page114">
114</a></span>
greater part of the skin of a reindeer fawn, with the back in the middle
and the sides and belly coming at the edges. The head of the animal is
made into the hood, which is continuous with the back. Each sleeve is in
two pieces, front and back, of the same shape, which are sewed together
along the upper edge, but separated below by the arm flap of the front,
which is bent down and inserted like a gusset from the armpit nearly to
the wrist. A&nbsp;band of deerskin an inch broad is sewed round the edge
of the hood, flesh side out. The trimming consists, first, of a narrow
strip of long-haired wolfskin (taken from the middle of the back) sewed
to the outer side of the binding of the hood, its ends separated by the
chin piece, so that the long hairs form a fringe around the face.
Similar strips are sewed round each wrist with the fur inward. The
binding round the skirt (Fig. 55<i>a</i>) is 2¼ inches broad. The
light-colored strips are clipped mountain sheep skin, the narrow pipings
are of the dark brown skin of a very young fawn, the little tags on the
second strip are of red worsted and the fringe is of wolverine fur,
sewed on with the flesh side, which is colored red, probably with ocher,
outward. A&nbsp;band of similar materials, arranged a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page115" id = "page115">
115</a></span>
little differently (Fig. 55<i>b</i>) and 1¼ inches broad, is inserted
into the body at each shoulder seam, so that the fringe makes a sort of
epaulet. This jacket is 24.5 inches long from the chin to the bottom of
the skirt, 21 inches wide across the shoulders, and 24.5 inches wide at
the bottom.</p>

<p>Apart from the trimming this is a very simple pattern. There are no
seams except those absolutely necessary for producing the shape, and the
best part of each skin is brought where it will show most, while the
poorer portions are out of sight under the arms.</p>

<p>The chief variation in deerskin frocks is in the trimming. All have
the hood fitted to the head and throat, with cheek and throat pieces,
and these are invariably white or light colored, even when the frock is
made of white Siberian deer skin. When possible the head of the deer is
always used for the back of the hood, as Capt. Parry observed to be the
custom at Iglulik.<a class = "tag" name = "tag209" id = "tag209" href =
"#note209">209</a> A&nbsp;plain frock is sometimes used for rough work,
hunting, etc. This has no fringe or trimming round the hood, skirt, or
wrists, the first being smoothly hemmed or bound with deerskin and the
last two left raw-edged. Fig. 56 shows such a jacket, which is often
made of very heavy winter deerskin. Most frocks, however, have the
border to the hood either of wolf or wolverine skin, in the latter case
especially having the end of the strips hanging down like tassels under
the chin. The long hairs give a certain amount of protection to the face
when walking in the wind.<a class = "tag" name = "tag210" id = "tag210"
href = "#note210">210</a> Instead of a fringe the hood sometimes has
three tufts of fur, one on each side and one above.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page116" id = "page116">
116</a></span>
<p>Trimmings of edging like that above described, or of plain wolverine
fur round the skirts and wrists, are common, and the shoulder straps
rather less so. Frocks are sometimes also fringed on the skirts and
seams with little strips of deerskin, after what the Point Barrow people
called the “Kûñmûdlĭñ” fashion.<a class = "tag" name = "tag211" id =
"tag211" href = "#note211">211</a> Nearly all the natives wear outer
frocks of deerskin, but on great occasions elaborately made garments of
other materials are sometimes seen. Nos. 56758 [87] (Fig. 57, <i>a</i>
and <i>b</i>) and 56757 [11] (Fig. 58, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>) are two
such frocks. No. 56758 [87] is of mountain sheep skin, nearly white. As
shown in the diagrams (Fig. 59, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>,&nbsp;<ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘c,)’"><i>c</i>),</ins> the general
pattern is not unlike the type described, but there are more pieces in
the hood and several small gussets are inserted to improve the set of
the garment. The trimmings are shoulder straps, and a border round the
skirt of edging like that described above, and the seams of the throat
pieces are piped with the dark almost hairless deerskin, which sets them
off from the rest of the coat. The wrists have narrow borders of wolf
fur, and there was a wolfskin fringe to the hood, which was removed
before the garment was offered for sale.</p>

skins, front and back.</p>

<p>No. 56757 [11] is a very handsome garment (Fig. 58). The body and
sleeves are of white and brown (winter and summer) ermine skins arranged
in an elegant pattern, and the hood of reindeer and mountain sheep skin.
This is the only frock seen in which the hood is not fitted to the sides
of the throat by curved and pointed throat pieces, after the fashion
universal among the western Eskimo, from Cape Bathurst at least to
Norton Sound. The pattern of the hood is shown by the diagram
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page117" id = "page117">
117</a></span>
(Fig. 60 <i>a</i>). The middle piece is the skin of a reindeer head, the
two cheek pieces and median chin piece of mountain sheep skin. When the
hood is put together the lower edge of it is sewed to the neck of the
body, which has the back and front of nearly the same size and shape
(diagram, Fig. 60 <i>b</i>), though the back is a little longer in the
skirt. There is no regular seam on the shoulders, where irregular bits
of white ermine skin are pieced together so as to fit. From the armpit
on each side runs a narrow strip of sheepskin between back and front.
The sleeve is a long piece made of three white ermine skins put together
lengthwise, doubled above, with a straight strip of sheepskin let in
below, and enlarged near the body by two triangular gussets (front and
back) let in between the ermine and sheepskin. The wristbands are broad
pieces of sheepskin. The skirts are of white ermine skins pieced
together irregularly, but the skins composing the front, back, and
sleeves are split down the back of the animal and neatly cut into long
rectangular pieces, with the feet and tails still attached. They are
arranged in a pattern of vertical stripes, two skins fastened together
end to end making a stripe, which is the same on the front and the back.
There is a brown stripe down the middle, then two white stripes on each
side, and a brown stripe on each edge. The hood is bound round the edge
with white sheepskin and bordered with wolfskin. There are shoulder
straps and a border round the skirt of edging of the usual materials,
but slightly different arrangement, and tagged with small red glass
beads.</p>

<p>The former owner of this beautiful frock (since dead) was always very
elegantly dressed. His deerskin clothes were always much trimmed, and he
owned an elegant frock of foxskins, alternately blue and white, with a
hood of deerskin, which we did not succeed in obtaining for the
collection. (The “jumper of mixed white and blue fox pelts,” seen by Dr.

<p>The woman’s frock differs from that worn by the men, in the shape of
the hood and skirts, as mentioned above, and it is also slightly fitted
in to the waist and made to “bag” somewhat in the back, in order to give
room for carrying the child. The pattern is considerably different from
that of the man’s frock, as will be seen from the description of the
type specimen (the only one in the collection), No. 74041 [1791] (Fig.
61, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), which is of deerskin. The hood is raised
into a little point on top and bulges out into a sort of rounded pocket
at the nape. This is a holiday garment, made of strips of skin from the
shanks and belly of the reindeer, pieced together so as to make a
pattern of alternating
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page119" id = "page119">
119</a></span>
light and dark stripes. The pattern is shown in the diagram, Fig. 62.
The sleeves are of the same pattern as those of No. 56751 [184]. The
edge of the hood is bound with deerskin, hair outwards. Trimming:
a&nbsp;strip of edging (Fig.&nbsp;63) in which the light stripes are
clipped white mountain sheepskin, the dark pipings brown, almost
hairless, fawnskin, and the tags red worsted, is inserted in the seam
between 7 on each side and 6 and 2, and a similar strip between the
inner edge of 3, 2, 7, 9, and 1. A&nbsp;broader strip of similar
insertion, fringed below with marten fur, with the flesh side out and
colored red, runs along the short seam <i>ffff</i>. The seam between 9
and 7 has a narrow piping of thin brown deerskin, tagged with red
worsted. A&nbsp;strip of edging, without tags and fringed with marten
fur (Fig.&nbsp;64), is inserted in the seam <i>gggg</i>. The border of
the skirt is 1 inch wide (Fig.&nbsp;64). The dark stripe is brown
deerskin, the white, mountain sheep, and the fur, marten, with the red
flesh side out. The fringes are double strips of white deerskin sewed to
the inside of the last seam, about 3 inches apart. The shoulder straps
are of edging like that at <i>g</i>, but have the fur sewed on so as to
show the red flesh side. The hood has a fringe of wolfskin sewed to the
outside of the binding. This frock measures 45 inches in the back, 32 in
the front, 19 across the shoulders, and 17 at the waist. The skirts are
21 inches wide, the front 18, and the back 20 inches long. The pieces 7,
8, and 9 of the hood are white. This is an unusually handsome
garment.</p>

<p>Deerskin garments rarely have the ornamental piecing seen in this
frock. Each one of the numbered parts of the pattern is generally in one
piece. The pieces 8 and 9 are almost universally white, and 7 is often
so. About the same variety in material and trimming is to be found as in
the men’s frocks, though deer and mountain sheep skins were the only
materials seen used, and the women’s frocks are less often seen without
the fringe round the hood. Plain deerskin frocks are often bordered
round the skirts with a fringe cut from deerskin. The
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page120" id = "page120">
120</a></span>
women nowadays often line the outer frock with drilling, bright calico,
or even bedticking, and then wear it with this side out.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 64.&mdash;Details of trimming,
woman’s frock.</p>

<p>The frocks for both sexes, while made on the same general pattern as
those of the other Eskimo, differ in many details from those of eastern
America. For instance, the hood is not fitted in round the throat with
the pointed throat pieces or fringed with wolf or wolverine skin until
we reach the Eskimo of the Anderson River. Here, as shown by the
specimens in the National Museum, the throat pieces are small and wide
apart, and the men’s hoods only are fringed with wolverine skin. The
women’s hoods are very large everywhere in the east for the better
accommodation of the child, which is sometimes carried wholly in the
hood.<a class = "tag" name = "tag213" id = "tag213" href =
"#note213">213</a></p>

<p>The hind flap of the skirt of the woman’s frock, except in Greenland,
has developed into a long narrow train reaching the ground, while the
front flap is very much decreased in size (see references just quoted).
The modern frock in Greenland is very short and has very small flaps
(see illustrations in Rink’s Tales, etc., pp. 8 and&nbsp;9), but the
ancient fashion, judging from the plate in Crantz’s History of
Greenland, referred to above, was much more like that worn by the
western Eskimo. In the Anderson and Mackenzie regions the flaps are
short and rounded and the front flap considerably the smaller. There is
less difference in the general shape of the men’s frocks. The hood is
generally rounded and close fitting, except in Labrador and Baffin Land,
where it is pointed on the crown. The skirt is sometimes prolonged into
rounded flaps and a short scallop in front, as at Iglulik and some parts
of Baffin Land.<a class = "tag" name = "tag214" id = "tag214" href =
"#note214">214</a> Petitot<a class = "tag" name = "tag215" id = "tag215"
href = "#note215">215</a> gives a full description of the dress of a
“chief” from the Anderson River. He calls the frock a “blouse échancrée
par côté et terminée en queues arrondies par devant et par derrière.”
The style of frock worn at Point Barrow is the prevalent one along the
western coast of America nearly to the Kuskokwim. On this river long
hoodless frocks reaching nearly or quite to the ground are worn.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag216" id = "tag216" href = "#note216">216</a> The

<p>The men of the Siberian Eskimo and sedentary Chukches, as at Plover
Bay, wear in summer a loose straight-bottomed frock without a hood, but
with a frill of long fur round the neck. The winter frock is described
as having “a&nbsp;square hood without trimmings, but capable of being
drawn, like the mouth of a bag, around the face by a string
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page121" id = "page121">

two which I saw worn at Plover Bay, namely, a&nbsp;close-fitting
nightcap of thin reindeer skin tied under the chin. The dress of the
Siberian women consists of frock and baggy kneebreeches in one piece,

"#clothing_style">Mantles.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>“Circular” mantles of deerskin, fastened at the neck by a thong, and
put on over the head like a poncho, are worn by the men in very cold
weather over their other clothes when lounging in the open air about the
village or watching at a seal hole or tending the seal nets at night.
The cloaks are especially affected by the older men, who, having
grown-up sons or sons-in-law, do not have to go sealing in winter, and
spend a great deal of their time in bright weather chatting together out
of doors. There is one specimen in the collection, No. 56760 [94]
(Fig.&nbsp;65). It is made of fine summer doe-reindeer skin, in three
pieces, back and two sides of dark skin, sewed to a collar of white skin
from the belly of the animal. For pattern see diagram (Fig.&nbsp;66).
The seams at <i>a</i> are gored to make the cloak hang properly from the
shoulder. The collar is in two pieces, joined in the middle, and the
edge <i>c</i> is turned over toward the hair side and “run” down in a
narrow hem. The points <i>b</i> of the collar are brought together in
the middle and joined by a little strap of deerskin about an inch long,
so that the edge <i>c</i> makes a round hole for the neck. The width of
the mantle is 60 inches and its depth 39. It is worn with the white
flesh side out, as is indicated by the seams being sewed “over
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page122" id = "page122">
122</a></span>
and over” on the hair side. All the mantles seen were essentially of the
same pattern. The edge is sometimes cut into an ornamental fringe, and
the flesh side marked with a few narrow stripes of red ocher. This
garment appears to be peculiar to northwestern America. No mention is to
be found of any such a thing except in Mr. MacFarlane’s MS. notes, where
he speaks of a deerskin blanket “attached with a line across the
shoulders in cold weather,” among the Anderson River Eskimo. We have no
means at present of knowing whether such cloaks are worn by the coast
natives between Point Barrow and Kotzebue Sound, but one was worn by one
of the Nunata´ñmiun who were at Nuwŭk in the autumn of 1881.</p>

<p>The rain-frock (silû´ña) is made of strips of seal or walrus
intestines about 3 inches broad, sewed together edge to edge. This
material is light yellowish brown, translucent, very light, and quite
waterproof. In shape the frock resembles a man’s frock, but the hood
comes well forward and fits closely round the face. It is generally
plain, but the seams are nowadays sewed with black or colored cotton for
ornament. The garment is of the same shape for both sexes, but the women
frequently cover the flesh side of a deerskin frock with strips of
entrail sewed together vertically, thus making a garment at once
waterproof and warm, which is worn alone in summer with the hair side
in. These gut shirts are worn over the clothes in summer when it rains
or when the wearer is working in the boats. There are no specimens in
the collection.</p>

<p>The kaiak jacket of black sealskin, so universal in Greenland, is
unknown at Point Barrow. The waterproof gut frocks are peculiar to the
western Eskimo, though shirts of seal gut, worn between the inner and
outer frock, are mentioned by Egede (p.&nbsp;130) and Crantz<a class =
"tag" name = "tag221" id = "tag221" href = "#note221">221</a> as used in
Greenland in their time. Ellis also<a class = "tag" name = "tag222" id =
"tag222" href = "#note222">222</a> says: “Some few of them [i.e., the
Eskimo of Hudsons Strait] wear shifts of seals’ bladders, sewed together
in pretty near the same form with those in Europe.” They have been
described generally under the name <i>kamleïka</i> (said to be a
Siberian word) by all the authors who have treated of the natives of
this region, Eskimo, Siberians, or Aleuts. We saw them worn by nearly
all the natives at Plover Bay. One handsome one was observed trimmed on
the seams with rows of little red nodules (pieces of the beak of one of
the puffins) and tiny tufts of black feathers.</p>

<p>The cotton frock, already alluded to as worn to keep the driving snow
out of the furs, is a long, loose shirt reaching to about midleg, with a
round hole at the neck large enough to admit the head. This is generally
of bright-colored calico, but shirts of white cotton are sometimes worn
when hunting on the ice or snow. Similar frocks are worn by the natives
at Pitlekaj.<a class = "tag" name = "tag223" id = "tag223" href =

<p>The hands are usually protected by mittens (aitkă´ti) of different
kinds of fur. The commonest kind are of deerskin, worn with the flesh
side out. Of these the collection contains one pair, No. 89828 [973]
(Fig.&nbsp;67). They are made of thick winter reindeer skin, with the
white flesh side outward, in the shape of ordinary mittens but short and
not narrowed at the wrists, with the thumb short and clumsy. The seams
are all sewed “over and over” on the hair side. These mittens are about
7½ inches long and 4½ broad. The free part of the thumb is only 2¼
inches long on the outer side. Such mittens are the ordinary hand
covering of men, women, and children. In extreme cold weather or during
winter hunting, very heavy mittens of the same shape, but gathered to a
wristband, are worn. These are made of white bearskin for men and women,
for children of dogskin, with the hair out. When the hand covered with
such a mitten is held upon the windward side of the face in walking, the
long hair affords a very efficient protection against the wind. The long
stiff hair of the bearskin also makes the mitten a very convenient brush
for removing snow and hoar frost from the clothes. It is even sometimes
used for brushing up the floor.</p>

<p>In the MacFarlane collection are similar mittens from the Mackenzie
region. Petitot<a class = "tag" name = "tag224" id = "tag224" href =
"#note224">224</a> says the Anderson River “chief” wore pualuk “mitaines
en peau de morse, aussi blanches et aussi soyeuses que de belle laine.”
These were probably of bearskin, as a mitten of walrus skin is not
likely to be “blanche” or “soyeuse.” Gloves are worn under these as at
Point Barrow. All these mittens are short in the wrist, barely meeting
the frock sleeve, and leaving a crack for the cold to get in, which is
partially covered by the usual wolf or wolverine skin fringe of the
sleeve. I&nbsp;have already mentioned the common habit among the women
of carrying only one mitten and drawing one arm inside of the frock.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag225" id = "tag225" href = "#note225">225</a>
The men, except when hunting, frequently wear only one of these heavy
mittens, which are called pu´alu. Waterproof mittens of black sealskin,
coming well up over the forearm, were also observed, but not obtained.
I&nbsp;do not remember ever seeing them in use.</p>

<p>Gloves of thin deerskin, worn with the hair in, and often elegantly
ornamented, are used with full dress, especially at the dances. As
already stated, the men wear such gloves under the pualu when shooting
in the winter. When ready to shoot, the hunter slips off the mitten and
holds it between his legs, while the glove enables him to cock the rifle
and draw the trigger without touching the cold metal with his bare
hands. There are two pairs of gloves in the collection. No. 89829 [974]
(Fig.&nbsp;68) illustrates a very common style called a´drigûdrĭn. They
are made of thin reindeer skin, with the white flesh side out, and are
rights and lefts. The short and rather clumsy fingers and thumbs are
separate pieces from the palm, which is one straight, broad piece,
doubled so as to bring the seam on the same side as the thumb. The
thumbs are not alike on both hands. The outside piece of the thumb runs
down to the wrist on the left glove, but is shorter on the right, the
lower 2 inches of the edge seam being between the edges of the palm
piece. Each finger is a single piece doubled lengthwise and sewed over
the tip and down one side. The wrists are ornamented with an edging of
two narrow strips of clipped mountain sheep skin, bordered with a narrow
strip of wolverine fur with the reddened flesh side out. These gloves
were made for sale and are not well mated, one being 8½ inches, with
fingers (all of the same length) 4½ inches long, while the other is 8
inches long with fingers of 3½ inches. No. 56747 [128] is a pair of
gloves made in the same way but more elaborately ornamented. There is a
band of deerskin but no fringe round the wrist. The back of the hand is
covered with brown deerskin, hair out, into which is inserted the square
ornamental pattern in which the light stripes are white deerskin and the
dark pipings the usual almost hairless fawnskin. Gloves like this type
are the most common and almost universally have a fringe round the
wrist. They are also usually a little longer-wristed than the
mittens.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page125" id = "page125">
125</a></span>
<p>Mittens are universally employed among the Eskimo, but gloves with
fingers, which, as is well known, are a much less warm covering for the
hand than mittens, are very rare. They are in use at Norton Sound<a
class = "tag" name = "tag226" id = "tag226" href = "#note226">226</a>
and in the Mackenzie district<a class = "tag" name = "tag227" id =
"tag227" href = "#note227">227</a>, and have even been observed among
the Arctic Highlanders of Smith Sound, who, however, generally wear
mittens<a class = "tag" name = "tag228" id = "tag228" href =
"#note228">228</a>. Dr. Simpson<a class = "tag" name = "tag229" id =
"tag229" href = "#note229">229</a> mentions both deerskin and bearskin
mittens as used at Point Barrow, but makes no reference to gloves. The
natural inference from this is that the fashion of wearing gloves has
been introduced since his time. It is quite probable that the
introduction of firearms has favored the general adoption of gloves. The
following hypothesis may be suggested as to the way the fashion reached
Point Barrow: We may suppose that the Malimiut of Norton Sound got the
idea directly from the Russians. They would carry the fashion to the
Nunatañmiun at Kotzebue Sound, who in their turn would teach it to the
Point Barrow traders at the Colville, and these would carry it on to the
eastern natives.</p>

<p>The usual leg-covering of the men is one or two pairs of knee
breeches, rather loose, but fitted to the shape of the leg. They are
very low in front, barely covering the pubes, but run up much higher
behind, sometimes as high as the small of the back. They are held in
place by a girdle of thong round the waist, and are usually fastened
below the knee, over the boots, by a drawstring. There is one pair in
the collection, No. 56759 [91], Fig. 69. They are of short-haired brown
reindeer skin, from the body of the animal, worn with the hair out. The
waist is higher behind than in front, and each leg is slightly gathered
to a band just below the knee. Pattern (see diagram, Fig.&nbsp;70):
There are two pieces in each leg, the inside and the outside. The spaces
between the edges <i>e</i> of the two legs is filled by the gusset,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page126" id = "page126">
126</a></span>
made of five pieces, which covers the pubes. The crotch is reinforced by
a square patch of white deerskin sewed on the inside. The trimming
consists of strips of edging. The first strip (Fig.&nbsp;71) is 1½
inches wide, and runs along the front seam, inserted in the outside
piece, to the knee-band, beginning 5 inches from the waist. The light
strips are of clipped mountain sheepskin; the dark one of dark brown
deerskin; the pipings of the thin fawn skin, and the tags of red
worsted. The edges of the strip are fringed with narrow double strips of
mountain sheepskin 2 inches long, put on about 1½ inches apart.
A&nbsp;straight strip, 2&nbsp;inches wide, is inserted obliquely across
the outside piece from seam to seam. It is of the same materials, but
differs slightly in pattern. The knee-band is of the same materials and
2½ inches deep. The length from waist to knee is 24 inches behind, 23 in
front; the girth of the leg 24 inches round the thigh and 14 round the
knee. These represent a common style of full-dress breeches, and are
worn with a pair of trimmed boots held up by <ins class = "correction" title =
". missing">drawstrings.</ins> They are always worn with the
hair out and usually over a pair of deerskin drawers. The ordinary
breeches are of heavier deerskin, made perfectly plain, being usually
worn alone, with the hair turned in. When a pair of under breeches is
worn, however, the hair of the outer ones is turned out. Trimmed
breeches are less common than trimmed frocks, as the plain breeches when
new are often worn for full dress. The clean, white flesh side presents
a very neat appearance. The skin of the rough seal is sometimes, but
rarely, used for summer breeches, which are worn with the hair out. With
this exception, breeches seem to be invariably made of deerskin. This
garment is practically universal among the Eskimo and varies very little
in pattern.</p>

(kûmûñ).&mdash;</h6>

<p>The women and children, and occasionally the men, wear pantaloons
(strictly speaking), i.e., tight-fitting trousers continuous with the
foot covering. Of the two pairs of pantaloons in the collection, No.
74042 [1792] (Fig.&nbsp;72) will serve as the type. The shoes with
sealskin moccasin soles and deerskin uppers are sewed at the ankles to a
pair of tight-fitting deerskin trousers, reaching above the hips and
higher behind than in front. Pattern (diagram, Fig. 73<i>a</i>): Each
leg is composed of four long pieces (front 1, outside 2, back 3, and
inside&nbsp;4), five gussets (one on the thigh 5, and four on the calf,
6, 6, 6,&nbsp;6), which enlarges the garment to fit the swell of the
calf and thigh and the half-waistband (7). The two legs are put together
by
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page127" id = "page127">
127</a></span>
joining the edges <i>d d d</i> of the opposite legs and sewing the
gusset (8) into the space in front with its base joined to the edges
<i>e e</i> of the two legs. The sole of each shoe is a single piece of
white tanned sealskin with the grain side out, bent up about 1¼ inches
all round the foot, rounded at the toe and heel and broadest across the
ball of the foot. The toe and heel are “gathered” into shape by crimping
the edge vertically. A&nbsp;space of about 3½ inches is left uncrimped
on each side of the foot. (The process of crimping these soles will be
described under the head of boots and shoes, where it properly belongs).
Around the top of this sole is sewed a narrow band of white sealskin,
sewed “over and over” on the edge of the uncrimped space, but “run”
through the gathers at the ends, so as to draw them up. The upper is in
two pieces (heel, 9, and toe,&nbsp;10). The heel piece is folded round
the heel, and the toe piece doubled along the line <i>f</i>, and the
curved edges <i>g g</i> joined to the straight edges <i>h h</i>, which
makes the folded edge <i>f</i>, fit the outline of the instep. The
bottom is then cut off accurately to fit the sole and sewed to the edge
of the band. The trousers and shoes are sewed together at the ankles.
The whole is made of the short-haired skin from the deer’s legs. Pieces
2, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are of dark brown skin (10&nbsp;put on so that the
tuft of coarse hair on the deer’s ankle comes on the outside of the
wearer’s ankle), while the remaining pieces are white, making a pleasing
pattern of broad stripes. The inner edge of 5 is piped with dark brown
fawnskin, and a round piece of white skin is inserted at the bottom of
2. No. 56748 [136] is a pair of pantaloons of nearly the same pattern
(see diagram, Fig. 73<i>b</i>) and put together in a similar way. These
pantaloons have soles of sealskin with the hair left on and worn inside,
and are made of deer leg skin, wholly dark brown, except the gussets on
the calf, which are white. There is a piece of white skin let out, 2, as
before, and the ankle tuft is in the same position.</p>

<p>From the general fit of these garments they appear to be all made on
essentially the same pattern, probably without greater variations than
those already described. When worn by the women the material is usually,
if not always, the skin of reindeer legs, and most commonly of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page128" id = "page128">
128</a></span>
the pattern of No. 56748 [136], namely, brown, with white leg gussets.
Pantaloons wholly of brown skin are quite common, especially for
everyday wear, while striped ones, like No. 74042 [1792], are much less
usual and worn specially for full dress. Children’s pantaloons are
always brown, and I have seen one pair, worn by a young lad, of lynx
skin. The two or three pairs which we saw worn by men were wholly brown.
These pantaloons of leg skin with sealskin soles are always worn with
the hair out and usually over a pair of under pantaloons of the same
shape, but made of softer skins with longer hair, which is worn next the
skin, and with stocking feet. The outer pantaloons are discarded in
summer and the inner ones only worn, the feet being protected by
sealskin waterproof boots, as already stated. The waterproof sealskin
pantaloons mentioned in the same connection do not fit so neatly, as
they are made with as few seams as possible (usually only one, up the
leg) to avoid leakage. They are sewed with the waterproof seam, and held
up round the ankle by strings, like the waterproof boots to be described
further on. This last-mentioned garment seems to be peculiar to the
Point Barrow region (including probably Wainwright Inlet and perhaps the
rest of the coast down to Kotzebue Sound). No mention of such a complete
protection against wet is to be found in any of the published accounts
of the Eskimo elsewhere, nor are there any specimens in the Museum.<a

<p>Boots and breeches united in this way so as to form pantaloons are
peculiar to the west of America, where they are universally worn from
the Mackenzie district westward and southward. We have no specimens of
women’s leg coverings from the Mackenzie district, but Petitot<a class =
"tag" name = "tag231" id = "tag231" href = "#note231">231</a> describes
them thus: “Le pantalon *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* fait corps avec la chaussure.”
In the east the women always wear breeches separate from the boots,
which usually differ from those of the men in their size and length,
often reaching to the hips.<a class = "tag" name = "tag232" id =

<p>Next to the skin on the feet and legs the men wear stockings of
deerskin, usually of soft, rather long-haired skin, with the hair in.
These are usually in three pieces, the leg, 1, toe piece, 2, and sole,
3&nbsp;(see diagram, Fig.&nbsp;74). A&nbsp;straight strip about 1 inch
wide often runs round the foot between the sole and the other pieces.
Stockings of this pattern, but made of very thick winter deerskin, are
substituted for the outer boots when deer-hunting in winter in the dry
snow, especially when snowshoes are used. They are warm; the flesh side
sheds the snow well and the thick hair acts as a sort of wadding which
keeps the feet from being galled by the bars and strings of the
snowshoes. Many of the deer-hunters in 1883 made rough buskins of this
pattern out of the skins of freshly killed deer simply dried, without
further preparation.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "clothing_leg_boots" id =
"clothing_leg_boots" href = "#clothing_leg">Boots and
shoes.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>Over the stockings are worn boots or shoes with uppers of various
kinds of skin, with the hair on, or black tanned sealskin, always fitted
to heelless crimped moccasin soles of some different leather, of the
pattern which, with some slight modifications of form, is universal
among the Eskimo. These soles are made as follows: A&nbsp;“blank” for
the sole is cut out, of the shape of the foot, but a couple of inches
larger all round. Then, beginning at one side of the ball of the foot,
the toe part is doubled over toward the inside of the sole, so that the
edges just match. The two parts are then pinched together with
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page130" id = "page130">
130</a></span>
the teeth along a line parallel to the folded edge and at a distance
from it equal to the depth of the intended fold. This bitten line runs
from the edge of the leather as far as it is intended to turn up the
side of the sole. A&nbsp;series of similar folds is carried round the
toe to a point on the other side of the sole opposite the starting
point. In the same way a series of crimps is carried round the heel,
leaving an uncrimped space of 2 or 3 inches on each side of the foot.
The sole is then sewed to a band or to the edge of the upper, with the
thread run through each fold of the crimps. This gathers the sole in at
the heel and toe and brings the uncrimped part straight up on each side
of the shank. When the folds are all of the same length and but slightly
gathered the sole is turned up nearly straight, as at the heel usually,
and at the toe also of waterproof boots. When the folds are long and
much gathered the sole slopes well in over the foot. Some boots,
especially those intended for full dress, have the sole deeper on the
sides than at the toe, so that the top of the sole comes to a point at
the toe. The ordinary pattern is about the same height all round and
follows the shape of the foot, being rather more gathered in over the
toe than at the heel. The “blank” for the sole is cut out by measuring
the size of the foot on the leather and allowing by eye the margin which
is to be turned up. The crimping is also done by eye. Any irregularity
in the length of the crimps can be remedied by pressing out the crease.
I&nbsp;have never seen at Point Barrow the ivory knives, such as are
used at Norton Sound for arranging the crimps.</p>

<p>Different kinds of leather are used for the soles, and each kind is
supposed to be best suited for a particular purpose. The beautiful white
urine-tanned sealskin is used for winter wear when the snow is dry, but
is not suited for standing the roughness and dampness of the salt-water
ice. For this purpose sealskin dressed with the hair on and worn flesh
side out is said to be the very best, preferable even to the various
waterproof skins used for summer boot soles. For waterproof soles are
used oil-dressed skins<a class = "tag" name = "tag233" id = "tag233"
href = "#note233">233</a> of the walrus, bearded seal, polar bear, or,
best of all, the white whale. This last makes a beautiful light yellow
translucent leather about 0.1 inch thick, which is quite durable and
keeps out water for a long time. It is highly prized and quite an
article of trade among the natives, a&nbsp;pair of soles usually
commanding a good price. These Eskimo appear to be the only ones who
have discovered the excellence of this material for waterproof soles, as
there is no mention to be found of its use elsewhere. The “narwhal skin”
spoken of by Dr. Simpson<a class = "tag" name = "tag234" id = "tag234"
href = "#note234">234</a> is probably this material, as he calls it
“Kel-lel´-lu-a,” which is the ordinary word for white whale at Point
Barrow. The narwhal is very rare in these waters, while the white whale
is comparatively abundant. Dr. Simpson appears not to have seen the
animal from which the skin was obtained. It is, however, by no means
impossible that <i>some</i> skins of the narwhal, which when dressed
would be indistinguishable
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page131" id = "page131">
131</a></span>
from the white whale skins, are obtained from the eastern natives or
elsewhere. Such crimped soles are in use among the Eskimo everywhere,
varying but little in general pattern. The Greenland boots are specially
noticeable for the neatness of the crimping, while specimens in the
Museum from the central region are decidedly slovenly in their
workmanship. The boots worn by the natives of Plover Bay have the sole
narrowed at the shank and hardly coming over the foot except at the toe
and heel, where they are crimped, but less deeply than usual. This style
of sole very much resembles those of a pair of Kamchatdale boots in the
National Museum, which, however, are turned up without crimping, as is
the case with the boots used by the Aleuts on the Commander Islands, of
which Dr. L.&nbsp;Stejneger has kindly shown me a specimen. There is a
folded “welt” of sealskin in the seam between the upper and sole of the
Plover Bay boots. I&nbsp;am informed by Capt. Herendeen that the natives
have been taught to put this in by the whalemen who every year purchase
large numbers of boots on the Siberian coast, for use in the Arctic.
Similar welts, which are very unusual on Eskimo boots, are to be seen on
some brought by Mr. Nelson from Kings Island and Norton Sound. The
winter boots usually have uppers of deerskin, generally the short-haired
skin from the legs. Mountain-sheep skin is sometimes used for full-dress
boots, and sealskin with the hair out for working boots. The latter is
not a good material, as the snow sticks to it badly. There are four
pairs of men’s winter boots in the collection, from which No. 56750
[111] (Fig.&nbsp;75) has been selected as the type of the everyday
pattern. They are made of deer-leg skin with white sealskin soles. Leg
and upper are in four pieces,<a class = "tag" name = "tag235" id =
"tag235" href = "#note235">235</a> back 1, two sides 2 2, and front 3;
1&nbsp;and 3 are gored at <i>a a a</i> to fit the swell of the calf;
1&nbsp;and 3 are of dark skin, and 2 2 lighter colored, especially along
the middle. The bottom is cut off accurately to fit the sole but the top
is left irregular, as this is concealed by the breeches. The boots are
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page132" id = "page132">
132</a></span>
held up round the ankles by two tie-strings of sealthong, sewed in
between the sole and the band, one on each side just under the middle of
the ankle. They are long enough to cross above the heel, pass once or
twice round the ankle, which fits more loosely than the rest of the
boot, and tie in front. On each heel is a large round patch of sealskin
with the hair on and pointing toward the toe (to&nbsp;prevent slipping).
These patches are carefully “blind-stitched” on so that the stitches do
not show on the outside.</p>

<p>Boots of this style are the common everyday wear of the men,
sometimes made wholly of dark deerskin and sometimes variegated. They
are often made of a pattern like that of the lower part of the women’s
pantaloons; that is, with the uppers separate from the leg pieces, which
are brown, with four white gussets on the calf. Fig. 77, No. 56759 [91],
is one of a pair of full-dress boots of a slightly different pattern.
The leg pieces are the same in number as in No. 56750, and put together
in the same way, but 2 and 3 are of a different shape.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag236" id = "tag236" href = "#note236">236</a> They are made of
deer-leg skins, each piece with a lighter streak down the middle. The
soles are of white sealskin, finely crimped, with the edge coming to a
point at the toe, and the five ornamental bands are of sealskin,
alternately black and white. A&nbsp;strip of edging three-fourths of an
inch wide is inserted in the seam between 2 and 3 on each side. The
light stripes are mountain-sheep skin and the dark ones the usual young
fawnskin, tagged with red worsted. The leg reaches to just below the
knee, and is hemmed over on the inside, to hold the drawstring, which
comes out behind. There are strings at the ankles as before.</p>

<p>Fig. 79, No. 89834 [770], is one of a pair of almost precisely the
same pattern as the last, but made of mountain-sheep skin. The soles are
more deeply turned up all round and have three ornamental bands of
sealskin around the edge, black, white, and black. Edging is inserted
into both the seams on each side. It is strips of mountain-sheep
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page133" id = "page133">
133</a></span>
skin and a dark brown deerskin, tagged with red worsted, with the edge
which laps over the side piece cut into oblique tags. There are no
tiestrings, as the soles are turned up high enough to stay in place
without them. These boots were brought from the east by one of the Nuwŭk
trading parties in 1882. Fig. 80, No. 56749 [110], is also a full-dress
boot, with soles like the last and no tiestrings. The leg is of two
pieces of dark brown deerskin with the hair clipped short. These pieces
are shaped like 2 in No. 56750, and the inner is larger, so that it laps
round the leg, bringing the seam on the outside. The leg is enlarged to
fit the swell of the calf by a large triangular gusset from the knee to
the midleg, meeting the inside piece in an oblique seam across the calf.
Instead of a hem, the top of the leg has a half-inch band sewed round it
and a binding for the drawstring above this. Edging is inserted in the
front seam, and obliquely across the outside of the leg. That in the
front seam is three narrow strips of deerskin, dark in the middle and
light on each side. The other is of mountain-sheep skin in three strips,
piped with fawnskin and tagged with worsted.</p>

<p>The boots belong with the breeches, No. 56759. They fairly represent
the style of full-dress boots worn with the loose-bottomed breeches.
They all have drawstrings just below the knee, and often have no
tie-strings at the ankles. The eastern Eskimo are everywhere described
as wearing the boots tied at the top with a drawstring and the bottoms
of the breeches usually loose and hanging down on them. Tying down the
breeches over the tops of the boots, as is done at Point Barrow, is an
improvement on the eastern fashion, as it closes the garments at the
knee so as to prevent the entrance of cold air. The same result is
obtained in an exactly opposite way by the people of Smith Sound, who,
according to Bessels (Naturalist, vol. 18, p.&nbsp;865), tie the boots
over the breeches.</p>

<p>All fur garments, including boots, are sewed in the same way, usually
with reindeer sinew, by fitting the edges together and sewing them “over
and over” on the “wrong” side. The waterproof boots of black sealskin,
however, are sewed with an elaborate double seam, which is quite
waterproof, and is made as follows: The two pieces are put together,
flesh side to flesh side, so that the edge of one projects beyond
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page134" id = "page134">
134</a></span>
the other, which is then “blind-stitched” down by sewing it “over and
over” on the edge, taking pains to run the stitches only part way
through the other piece. The seam is then turned and the edge of the
outer piece is turned in and “run” down to the grain side of the under
with fine stitches which do not run through to the flesh side of it.
Thus in neither seam are there holes through both pieces at once. The
sewing is done with fine sinew thread and very fine round needles (the
women used to ask for “little needles, like a hair”), and the edge of
the leather is softened by wetting it in the mouth. A&nbsp;similar
waterproof seam is used in sewing together boat covers.</p>

<p>There is one pair of waterproof boots in the collection (No. 76182
[1794] Fig.&nbsp;81). The tops are of black dressed sealskin, reaching
to the knee and especially full on the instep and ankle, which results
from their being made with the least possible number of seams, to reduce
the chance of leaking. The soles are of white whale skin, turned up
about 1½ inches all around. The leg and upper are made all in one piece
so that the double water-tight seam runs down the front of the leg to
the instep, and then diagonally across the foot to the quarter on one
side. The bottom is cut off accurately to fit the top of the sole. The
edges of the upper and the sole are put together so that the inside of
the former comes against the inside of the latter, and the two are “run”
together with fine stitches, with a stout double under-thread running
through them along the surface of the upper. The ornamental band at the
top is of white sealskin “run” on with strong dark thread, and the
checkered pattern is made by drawing a strip of black skin through slits
in the white. Round the top of the band is sewed a binding of black
sealskin, which holds a drawstring of sinew braid. The sole is kept up
in shape and the boot made to fit round the ankle by a string of
sealskin twine passed through four loops, one on each side just back of
the ball of the foot, and one on each quarter. These loops are made of
little strips of white whale skin, doubled over and sewed to the edge of
the sole on the outside. The ends of the string are passed through the
front loop so that the bight
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page135" id = "page135">
135</a></span>
comes across the ball of the foot, then through the hinder loops, and
are crossed above the heel, carried once or twice around the ankle, and
tied in front.</p>

<p>Such boots are universally worn in summer. The men’s boots are
usually left with an irregular edge at the top, and are held up by the
breeches, while the women’s usually have white bands around the tops
with drawstrings. Half-boots of the same material, reaching to midleg,
without drawstrings, or shoes reaching just above the ankle with a
string round the top are sometimes worn over the deerskin boots. Similar
shoes of deerskin are sometimes worn in place of boots.</p>

<p>Waterproof boots of black sealskin are universally employed by Eskimo
and by the Aleuts. These boots stand water for a long time without
getting wet through, but when they become wet they must be turned inside
out and dried very slowly to prevent them from shrinking, and worked
soft with a stone skin-dressing tool or the teeth. The natives prefer to
dry them in the sun. When the black epidermis wears off this leather is
no longer waterproof, so that the women are always on the watch for
white spots, which are mended with water-tight patches as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>In the early spring, before it thaws enough to render waterproof
boots necessary, the surface of the snow becomes very smooth and
slippery. To enable themselves to walk on this surface without falling,
the natives make a kind of “creeper” out of strips of sealskin. These
are doubled lengthwise, and generally bent into a half-moon or horseshoe
shape, with the folded edges on the outside of the curve, sewed on the
toe and heel of the sealskin sole, as represented in Fig. 82.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 83.&mdash;Man’s belt woven of
feathers. The lower cut shows detail of pattern.</p>

<p>No. 89544 [1419] (Fig. 83<i>a</i>) has been chosen as the type of a
man’s belt. It is 35 inches long and 1 inch broad, and made of the
shafts of feathers woven into an elegant pattern, bordered on the edges
with deerskin, and terminating in a leather loop at one end and a
braided string at the other. The loop is a flat piece of skin of the
bearded seal, in which is cut a large oblong eye. The weaving begins at
the square end of the loop. The warp consists of nine long strands sewed
through the inner face of the leather so as to come out on the hinder
edge. The middle strand is of stout sinew braid, ending in a knot on the
inner side of the leather. The four on each side are of fine cotton
twine or stout thread, each two being one continuous thread passing
through the leather and out again. The woof is the shafts of small
feathers regularly woven, the first strand woven over and under, ending
over the warp, the next under and over, ending under the warp, and so on
alternately, each strand extending about one-fourth inch beyond the
outer warp-strand on each side. This makes the pattern shown in Fig.
83<i>b</i>, a long stitch on each side, three very short ones on each
side of the middle, and a slightly longer one in the middle. The strips
of feathers forming the woof are not joined together, but one strip is
woven in as far as it will go, ending always on the inner side of the
belt, a&nbsp;new strip beginning where the other ends. The shafts of
black feathers, with a few of the barbs attached, are
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page137" id = "page137">
137</a></span>
woven into the woof at tolerably regular intervals. Each black strand
starts under the first strand of the warp, making the outer and inner of
the three short stitches on each side black. This produces a checkered
pattern along the middle of the belt (see enlarged section, Fig.
83<i>b</i>). The woof strands are driven home tightly and their ends are
secured on each side by a double thread of cotton sewed into the corner
of the leather loop. One thread runs along the outside of the belt and
the other along the inside, passing between the ends of the feathers
about every ten feathers and making a turn round the outer thread, as in
Fig. 84. The edges of the belt are trimmed off even and bound with a
narrow strip of deerskin with the flesh side out and painted red. The
binding of the upper edge makes an irregular loose lining on the inside
of the belt. Across the end of the belt is sewed on each side a narrow
strip of sealskin, and the ends of the warp are gathered into a
three-ply braid 16 inches long, which is used to fasten the belt by
drawing it through the loop and knotting it. An ancient bone spearhead
is attached to the belt as an amulet by a stout strap.</p>

<p>No. 89543 [1420] is a similar belt worn in precisely the same way,
but with the black feathers introduced in a different pattern. The
weaving is done by hand with the help of some little tools, to be
described under implements for making and working fiber. Belts of this
style appear to be peculiar to the Point Barrow region. Indeed, girdles
of any kind are seldom worn over the jacket by the men in the eastern

eight nearly equidistant claws making a fringe round the lower edge of

of a narrow strip of deerskin about 8 inches long. These strings serve
to tie the girdle. This belt is 33 inches long and 1½ inches wide, and
has been worn so long that the inside is very dirty. Such belts are very

<p>In addition to the trimmings above described there are certain
ornamental appendages which belong to the dress, but can not be
considered as essential parts of any garments, like the trimmings. For
instance, nearly every male in the two villages wears dangling from his
back between the shoulders an ermine skin either brown or white, or an
eagle’s feather, which is transferred to the new garment when the old
one is worn out. This is perhaps an amulet as well as an ornament, as
Dr. Simpson states.<a class = "tag" name = "tag237" id = "tag237" href =
"#note237">237</a> An eagle’s feather is often worn on the outside of
the hood, pendant from the crown of the head. Attached to the belt are
various amulets (to&nbsp;be described under the head of “Religion”) and
at the back always the tail of an animal, usually a wolverine’s. Very
seldom a wolf’s tail is worn, but nearly all, even the boys, have
wolverine tails, which are always saved for this purpose and used for no
other. This habit among the Eskimo of western America of wearing a tail
at the girdle has been noticed by many travelers, and prevails at least
as far as the Anderson River, since Petitot,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag238" id = "tag238" href = "#note238">238</a> in describing the dress
of the Anderson River “chief,” says: “par derrière il portait aux reins

<p>The custom of tattooing is almost universal among the women, but the
marks are confined almost exclusively to the chin and form a very simple
pattern. This consists of one, three, five, or perhaps as
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page139" id = "page139">
139</a></span>
many as seven vertical lines from the under lip to the tip of the chin,
slightly radiating when there are more than one. When there is a single
line, which is rather rare, it is generally broad, and the middle line
is sometimes broader than the others. The women as a rule are not
tattooed until they reach a marriageable age, though there were a few
little girls in the two villages who had a single line on the chin.
I&nbsp;remember seeing but one married woman in either village who was
not tattooed, and she had come from a distant settlement, from Point
Hope, as well as we could understand.</p>

<p>Tattooing on a man is a mark of distinction. Those men who are, or
have been, captains of whaling umiaks that have taken whales have marks
to indicate this tattooed somewhere on their persons, sometimes forming
a definite tally. For instance, Añoru had a broad band across each cheek
from the corners of the mouth (Fig. 87, from a sketch by the writer),
made up of many indistinct lines, which was said to indicate “many
whales.” Amaiyuna had the “flukes” of seven whales in a line across his
chest, and Mû´ñialu had a couple of small marks on one forearm.
Niăksára, the wife of Añoru, also had a little mark tattooed in each
corner of her mouth, which she said were “whale marks,” indicating that
she was the wife of a successful whaleman. Such marks, according to
Petitot (Monographie, etc., p.&nbsp;xv) are a part of the usual pattern
in the Mackenzie district&mdash;“deux traits aux commissures de la
bouche.” One or two men at Nuwŭk had each a narrow line across the face,
over the bridge of the nose, which were probably also “whale marks,”
though we never could get a definite answer concerning them.<a class =

<p>The tattooing is done with a needle and thread, smeared with soot or
gunpowder, giving a peculiar pitted appearance to the lines. It is
rather a painful operation, producing considerable inflammation and
swelling, which lasts several days. The practice of tattooing the women
is almost universal among the Eskimo, from Greenland to Kadiak,
including the Eskimo of Siberia, the only exception being the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page140" id = "page140">

the Eskimo who have much intercourse with the whites.<a class = "tag"

<p>The simple pattern of straight, slightly diverging lines on the chin
seems to prevail from the Mackenzie district to Kadiak, and similar chin
lines appear always to form part of the more elaborate patterns,
sometimes extending to the arms and other parts of the body, in fashion
among the eastern Eskimo<a class = "tag" name = "tag243" id = "tag243"

<p>The men and boys wear their hair combed down straight over the

circular tonsure on the crown of the head, and a strip is generally
clipped down to the nape of the neck. (See Fig. 89, from a sketch from
life by the writer.) The natives believe that this clipping of the back
of the head prevents snow blindness in the spring. The people of the
Mackenzie district have a different theory. “La large

front hair long, parted in the middle, and confined by a narrow fillet
of leather round the brow. The hair on the tonsure is not always kept
clipped very close, but sometimes allowed to grow as much as an inch
long, which probably led Hooper to believe that the tonsure was not
common at Point Barrow.<a class = "tag" name = "tag247" id = "tag247"

and was occasionally observed at Iglulik by Capt. Parry (2d&nbsp;Voy.,

leave only a fringe round the head.<a class = "tag" name = "tag250" id =

<p>Some of the men and boys wear across the forehead a string of large
blue glass beads, sometimes sewed on a strip of deerskin. Occasionally,
also a fillet is worn made of the skin of the head of a fox or a dog,
with the nose coming in the middle of the forehead. Such head-dresses
are by no means common and seem to be highly prized, as they were never
offered for sale. MacFarlane (MS.) speaks of a similar head-dress worn
at the Anderson River, “generally made of the skin of the fore part of
the head skins of wolves, wolverines, and marmots. Very often, however,
a&nbsp;string of beads is made use of instead.” Another style of
head-dress is the badge of a whaleman, and is worn only when whaling
(and, I&nbsp;believe, at the ceremonies in the spring preparatory to the
whaling). This seems to be very highly prized, and is, perhaps, “looked
upon with superstitious regard.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag252" id =
"tag252" href = "#note252">252</a> None were ever offered for sale and
we had only two or three opportunities of seeing it. It consists of a
broad fillet of mountain-sheep skin, with pendants of flint, jasper, or
crystal, rudely flaked into the shape of a whale (see under “Amulets,”
where specimens are described and figured), one in the middle of the
brow and one over each ear. Some of them are also fringed with the
incisor teeth of the mountain sheep attached by means of a small hole
drilled through the end of the root, as on the dancing cap (see under
“Games and Pastimes”). The captain and harpooner of a whaling crew which
I saw starting out in the spring of 1882 each wore one of these fillets.
The harpooner’s had only the whale pendants, but the captain’s was also
fringed with teeth. This ornament closely resembles the fillet fringed
with deer’s teeth, observed by Capt. Parry at Iglulik,<a class = "tag"

<p>Nearly all the women and girls perforate the lobes of the ears and
wear earrings. The commonest pattern is a little hook of ivory to which
are attached pendants, short strings of beads, etc. Large, oblong,
dark-blue beads and bugles are specially desired for this purpose. Cheap
brass or “brummagem” earrings are sometimes worn nowadays. The fashion
in earrings seems to have changed somewhat since Dr. Simpson’s time, as
I do not remember ever having seen the long strings of beads hanging
across the breast or looped up behind as he describes them.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag254" id = "tag254" href = "#note254">254</a> At

<p>As has been stated by all travelers who have visited Point Barrow
since the time of Elson, all the adult males wear the labrets or
stud-shaped lip ornaments. The discussion of the origin and extent of
this habit, or even a comparison of the forms of labrets in use among
the Eskimo, would lead me far beyond the scope of the present work.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag255" id = "tag255" href = "#note255">255</a>
They are or have been worn by all the Eskimo of western America,
including St. Lawrence Island and the Diomedes, from the most southern
point of their range to the Mackenzie and Anderson district, and were
also worn by Aleuts in ancient times.<a class = "tag" name = "tag256" id
= "tag256" href = "#note256">256</a> East of the Mackenzie district no
traces of the habit are to be observed. Petitot<a class = "tag" name =
"tag257" id = "tag257" href = "#note257">257</a> says that Cape Bathurst
is the most eastern point at which labrets are worn. The custom of
wearing them at this place is perhaps recent, as Dr. Armstrong, of the
<i>Investigator</i>, expressly states that he saw none there in 1850. At
Plover Bay, eastern Siberia, however, I&nbsp;noticed one or two men with
a little cross or circle <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads‘tattoed’">tattooed</ins> under each corner of the mouth, just in the
position of the labret. This may be a reminiscence of an ancient habit
of wearing labrets, or may have been done in imitation of the people of
the Diomedes and the American coast.</p>

<p>At Point Barrow at the present day the lip is always pierced for two
labrets, one at each corner of the mouth, though one or both of them are
frequently left out. They told us, however, that in ancient times a
single labret only was worn, for which the lip was pierced directly in
the middle. Certain old and large-sized labrets in the collection are
said to have been thus worn. The incisions for the labrets appear to be
made about the age of puberty, though I knew one young man who had been
married for some months before he had the operation performed. From the
young man’s character, I&nbsp;fancy shyness or timidity, as suggested by
Dr. Simpson,<a class = "tag" name = "tag258" id = "tag258" href =
"#note258">258</a> had something to do with the delay. Contrary to Dr.
Simpson’s experience, I&nbsp;did not see a single man above the age of
18 or 19 who did not wear the labrets. It seems hardly probable that
ability
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page144" id = "page144">
144</a></span>
to take a seal entitles a boy to wear labrets, as he suggests. We knew a
number of boys who were excellent seal hunters and even able to manage a
kaiak, but none had their lips pierced under the age of 14 or 15, when
they may be supposed to have reached manhood. The incisions are at first
only large enough to admit a flat-headed pin of walrus ivory, about the
diameter of a crow quill, worn with the head resting against the gum.
These are soon replaced by a slightly stouter pair, and these again by
stouter ones, until the holes are stretched to a diameter of about
one-half inch, when they are ready for the labrets.</p>

<p>We heard of no special ceremonies or festivals connected with the
making of these incisions, such as Dall observed at Norton Sound,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag259" id = "tag259" href = "#note259">259</a>
but in the one case where the operation was performed at the village of
Utkiavwĭñ during our stay, we learned that it was done by a man outside
of the family of the youth operated upon. We were also informed that the
incisions must be made with a little lancet of slate. The employment of
an implement of ancient form and obsolete material for this purpose
indicates, as Dall says in the passage referred to above, “some greater
significance than mere ornamentation.”</p>

<p>The collection contains two specimens of such lancets. No. 89721
[1153] (figured in Rept. Point Barrow Expedition, Ethnology, Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">V</span>, Fig.&nbsp;4) is the type. A&nbsp;little
blade of soft gray slate is carefully inclosed in a neat case of
cottonwood. The blade is lanceolate, 1.3 inches long, 0.6 broad, and 0.1
thick, with a short, broad tang. The faces are somewhat rough, and
ground with a broad bevel to very sharp cutting edges. The case is made
of two similar pieces of wood, flat on one side and rounded on the
other, so that when put together they make a rounded body 3 inches long,
slightly flattened, and tapering toward the rounded ends, of which one
is somewhat larger than the other. Round each end is a narrow, deep,
transverse groove for a string to hold the two parts together.
A&nbsp;shallow median groove connects these cross grooves on one piece,
which is hollowed out on the flat face into a rough cavity of a shape
and size suitable to receive the blade, which is produced into a narrow,
deep groove at the point, probably to keep the point of the blade from
being dulled by touching the wood. The other piece, which serves as a
cover, has merely a rough, shallow, oval depression near the middle. The
whole is evidently very old, and the case is browned with age and
dirt.</p>

hole in the tip for the transverse wooden peg, which is not used at
Point Barrow. One youth was wearing the final size of plugs when we
landed at the station. These were brought to a point like the tip of a
walrus tusk, and had exactly the appearance of the tusks of a young
walrus when they first protrude beyond the lip. The labrets worn at
Point Barrow at the present day are usually of two patterns. One is a
large, flat, circular disk about 1½ inches in diameter, with a flat stud
on the back something like that of a sleevebutton, and the other a thick
cylindrical plug about 1 inch long, and one-half inch in diameter, with
the protruded end rounded and the other expanded into an oblong flange,
presenting a slightly curved surface to the gum. These plug labrets are
the common fashion for everyday wear, and at the present day, as in Dr.

<p>One of the Nunatañmiun wore a glass cruet-stopper for a labret, and
many natives of Utkiavwĭñ took the glass stopples of Worcestershire
sauce bottles, which were thrown away at the station, and inserted them
in the labret holes for everyday wear, sometimes grinding the round top
into an oblong stud. There is one specimen of the plug labret in the
collection. Labrets of all kinds are very highly prized, and it was
almost impossible to obtain them.<a class = "tag" name = "tag261" id =
"tag261" href = "#note261">261</a> Though we repeatedly asked for them
and promised to pay a good price, genuine labrets that had been worn or
that were intended for actual use were very rarely offered for sale,
though at one time a large number of roughly made models or imitations
were brought in. The single specimen of the plug labret (tu´tɐ) is No.
89700 [1163] (figured in Point Barrow Report, Ethnology, Pl. <span class
= "smallroman">V</span>, Fig.&nbsp;3). It is a cylindrical plug of hard,
bright green stone (jade or hypochlorite), 1.1 inches long and 0.6 in
diameter at the outer end, which is rounded off, tapering slightly
inward and expanded at the base into an elliptical disk 1.2 inches long
and 0.9 broad, slightly concave on the surface which rests against the
teeth and gum. The specimen is old and of a material very unusual at
Point Barrow. Fig. 92, No. 89719 [1166], from Nuwŭk, may also be called
a plug labret, but is of a very unusual pattern, and said to be very
old. It has an oblong stud of walrus ivory surmounted by a large,
transparent, slightly greenish glass bead, on top of which is a small,
translucent, sky-blue bead. The beads are held on by a short wooden peg,
running through the perforations of the beads and a hole drilled through
the ivory. There is a somewhat similar labret in the Museum collection
(No.&nbsp;48202)
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page146" id = "page146">
146</a></span>
from Cape Prince of Wales, also very old. It is surmounted by a single
oblong blue bead.</p>

<p>I saw but one other labret made of whole beads, and this had three
good sized oval blue beads, in a cluster, projecting from the hole. It
was worn by a man from Nuwŭk. This may be compared with a specimen from
the Mackenzie district, No. 7714, to which two similar beads are
attached in the same way. The disk labret is the pattern worn on
full-dress occasions, seldom when working or hunting. One disk and one
plug labret are frequently worn. Disk labrets are made of stone,
sometimes of syenite or porphyry, but the most fashionable kind is made
of white marble, and has half of a large, blue glass bead cemented on
the center of the disk. These are as highly prized as they were in Dr.
Simpson’s time, and we consequently did not succeed in procuring a
specimen.</p>

<p>I obtained one pair of syenite disk labrets, No. 56716 [197] (figured
in Point Barrow Rept., Ethnology, Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">V</span>, Fig.&nbsp;2). Each is a flat circular disk (1.7
and 1.6 inches in diameter, respectively) of rather coarse-grained black
and white syenite, ground very smooth, but not polished. On the back of
each is an elliptical stud, like that of a sleeve-button, 1.2 and 1.1
inches long and 0.8 and 0.6 broad, respectively.</p>

<p>Fig. 93, No. 2083, is one of the blue and white disks said to come
from the Anderson River. This is introduced to represent those worn at
Point Barrow, which are of precisely the same pattern. The disk is of
white marble, 1½ inches in diameter, and in the center of it is
cemented, apparently with oil dregs, half of a transparent blue glass
bead, three-quarters of an inch in diameter, around the middle of which
is cut a shallow groove. Similar marble disks without the bead are
sometimes worn. These blue and white labrets appear to be worn from Cape
Bathurst to the Kaniag peninsula, including the Diomede Islands (see
figure on p.&nbsp;140 of Dall’s Alaska). There are specimens in the
Museum from the Anderson River and from the north shore of Norton Sound
and we saw them worn by the Nunatañmiun, as well as the natives of Point
Barrow and Wainwright Inlet. The beads, which are larger than those sold
by the American traders, were undoubtedly obtained from Siberia, as
Kotzebue, in 1816, found the people of the sound which bears his name
wearing labrets “ornamented with blue glass beads.”<a class = "tag" name

writers speak of them as made of walrus ivory.</p>

<p>There are still at Point Barrow a few labrets of a very ancient
pattern, such as are said to have been worn in the middle of the lip.
These are very rarely put on, but are often carried by the owners on the
belt as amulets. All that we saw were of light green translucent jade,
highly polished. I&nbsp;obtained one specimen, No. 89705 [866] (figured
in Point Barrow Rept., Ethnology, Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">V</span>, Fig.&nbsp;1), a&nbsp;thin oblong disk of light
green, translucent, polished jade, 2.6 inches long, 1.1 wide in the
middle, and 0.8 wide at the ends, with the outer face slightly convex.
On the back is an oblong stud with rounded ends, slightly curved to fit
the gums.</p>

<p>Labrets of this material and pattern do not seem to be common
anywhere. Beechey saw one in Kotzebue Sound 3 inches long and 1½ wide,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag266" id = "tag266" href = "#note266">266</a>

received from Kotzebue Sound.</p>

<p>Fig. 94, No. 89712 [1169], from Sidaru is a labret of similar shape,
3&nbsp;inches long and 1½ broad, but made of compact bone, rather neatly
carved and ground smooth. It shows some signs of having been worn. There
are marks on the stud where it appears to have been rubbed against the
teeth, and it is probably genuine. The purchase of this specimen
apparently started the manufacture of bone labrets at Utkiavwĭñ, where
no bone labrets, old or new, had previously been seen. For several days
after we bought the specimen from Sidaru the natives continued to bring
over bone labrets, but all so newly and clumsily made that we declined
to purchase any more than four specimens. About the same time they began
to make oblong labrets out of soapstone (a&nbsp;material which we never
saw used for genuine labrets), like Fig. 95, No. 89707 [1215]. The
purchase of three specimens of these started a wholesale manufacture of
them, and we stopped purchasing.</p>

<p>Nos. 89304 [1713], 89716 [1042], and 89717 [1031] (Fig. 96) are very
old labrets, which are interesting from their resemblance to the ancient
Aleutian single labrets found by Dall in the cave on Amaknak Island.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag268" id = "tag268" href = "#note268">268</a>
No. 89304 [1713] is an elliptical plug of bituminous coal, with a
projecting flange round the base, which is slightly concave to fit the
curve of the jaw. This labret is very old and was said to have been
found in one of the ruined houses in Utkiavwĭñ. The other two labrets
are of walrus ivory and of similar shape, but have the flange only at
the ends of the base. All of these three are large, the largest being
2.2 inches wide and 0.7 thick, and the smallest 1.3 by 0.5, so that they
required a much larger incision in the lip than is at present made. In
connection with what has been said of the ancient habit of wearing
labrets in the middle of the lip, it is interesting to note that
Nordenskiöld saw men at Port Clarence who had, besides the ordinary
labret holes, “a&nbsp;similar hole forward in the lip.”<a class = "tag"

<p>The women all wear bracelets, which are sometimes strings of beads,
but more commonly circles of iron, brass, or copper wire, of which
several are often worn on the same wrist, after the fashion of bangles.
The men also sometimes wear bracelets. These consist of circles

strips of seal thong 0.2 inch broad, bent into rings (9.4 and 8.6 inches

sewed together. On each is strung a cylindrical bead of soapstone about
one-half inch long and of the same diameter. A&nbsp;single bracelet is

<p>In addition to the ornaments already described, the women use short
strings of beads, buttons, etc., to ornament various parts of the dress,
especially the outer side of the inner frock (i´lupa), and strings of
beads are often attached to various objects, such as pipes, tobacco
pouches, etc. One or two women were also observed to wear large bunches
of beads and buttons attached to the inner girdle in front so as to hang
down between the legs inside of the pantaloons. A&nbsp;similar strange
custom was observed by Beechey at Hotham Inlet, where a young woman wore
a good-sized metal bell in the same uncomfortable manner.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag271" id = "tag271" href = "#note271">271</a> These
people appear to have attempted the manufacture of beads in former
times, when they were not so easily obtained as at present. There is in
the collection a string of four small beads made from amber picked up on
the beach (Fig. 97, No. 89700 [1716]). They are of dark honey-colored
transparent amber, about one-third inch long and one-half inch diameter
at the base. Such beads are very rare at the present day. The above

<h5><a name = "adornment_toilet" id = "adornment_toilet" href =

<p>The only object in use among these people that can be considered a
toilet article is the small hair comb (<ins class = "correction" title =
"anomalous superscript in original">ĭ<sup>d</sup>lai´utĭn</ins>),
usually made of walrus ivory.</p>

<p>The collection contains ten specimens, from which No. 56566<i>b</i>
[182] (Fig. 98<i>a</i>) has been selected as the type. It is made of
walrus ivory (from near the root of the tusk). When in use, it is held
with the tip of the forefinger in the ring, the thumb and middle finger
resting on each
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page150" id = "page150">
150</a></span>
side of the neck. This is perhaps the commonest form of the comb, though
it is often made with two curved arms at the top instead of a ring, as
in Fig. 98<i>b</i>, No. 56569 [194], or sometimes with a plain top, like
No. 56572 [210] (Fig. 98<i>c</i>). Nine of the ten combs, all from
Utkiavwĭñ, are of walrus ivory, but No. 89785 [1006], which was the
property of Ilû´bwga, the Nunatañmiun, who spent the winter of 1882-’83
at Utkiavwĭñ, is made of reindeer antler. This was probably made in the
interior, where antler is more plentiful than ivory. All these combs are
made with great care and patience. The teeth are usually cut with a saw,
but on one specimen the maker used the sharp edge of a piece of tin, as
we had refused to loan him a fine saw. This kind of comb is very like
that described by Parry from Iglulik.<a class = "tag" name = "tag272" id

“Ootiwakh” (Utkiavwĭñ) as 225. Refuge Inlet (where there is merely a
summer camp of Utkiavwĭñmiun), 40, and “Kokmullit,” 200. The supposed

The history of this word, which also appears as a Chuckch word in some
of the vocabularies collected by Nordenskiöld’s expedition, is rather
curious. Chamisso (Kotzebue’s Voyage, vol. 2, p.&nbsp;392, foot-note)
says that this is a Hawaiian corruption of the well-known
“Pigeon-English” (he&nbsp;calls it Chinese) word “chow-chow” recently
(in&nbsp;1816-’17) adopted by the Sandwich Islanders from the people
with whom they trade. I&nbsp;am informed that the word is not of Chinese
origin, but probably came from India, like many other words in
“Pigeon-English.” Chamisso also calls <i>pûnĭ-pûnĭ</i> a Chinese word,
but I have been able to learn nothing of its origin.</p>

into the Water they drink, to make it cooler for to quench their Thirst”
(p.&nbsp;135). “Their drink is clear water, which stands in the house in
a great copper vessel, or in a wooden tub. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* They bring in
a supply of fresh water every day *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and that their water
may be cool they choose to lay a piece of ice or a little snow in it”

above described, obtaining the hair from a strip of dogskin tied to the
pipe. Their tobacco was mixed with wood. Voyage, p.&nbsp;300. Petitot
(Monographie, etc., p.&nbsp;xxix) describes a precisely similar method
of smoking among the Mackenzie Eskimos. Their tobacco was “melangé à de
la ráclure de saule” and the pipe was called “kwiñeρk.” (Vocabulaire,

This is an interesting fact, as it shows that the Eskimo from
Demarcation Point east learned to smoke from the people of Point Barrow,
and not from the English or the northern Indians, who use pipes “modeled
after the clay pipes of the Hudson Bay Company.” (Dall, Alaska,
p.&nbsp;81, Fig. <i>A</i>.) They acquired the habit some time between
1837, when T.&nbsp;Simpson found them ignorant of the use of tobacco
(see reference above, p.&nbsp;65), and 1849, when they were glad to
receive it from Pullen and Hooper. (Tents, etc., p.&nbsp;258.) Petitot
(Monographie, etc., p.&nbsp;xxvi) states that the Eskimo of the
Mackenzie informed him that the use of tobacco and the form of the pipe,
with blue beads, labrets, and other things, came through the neighbors
from a distant land called “Nate´ρovik,” which he supposes to mean St.
Michaels, but which, from the evidence of other travelers, is much more
likely to mean Siberia.</p>

<p class = "continue">The Eskimo geography, on which Fr. Petitot relies
so strongly, is extremely vague west of Barter Island, and savors of the
fabulous almost as much as the Point Barrow stories about the eastern
natives. The evidence which leads Fr. Petitot to believe “Nate´ρovik” to
be St. Michaels is rather peculiar. The Mackenzie natives call the
people who are nearest to Nate´ρovik on the north “the Sedentary.” Now,
the people who live nearest to St. Michaels on the north are the
“Sedentary American Tchukatchīs”(!); therefore Nate´ρovik is probably
St. Michaels. (“Le nom <i>Natéρovik</i> semble convenir à l’ancien fort
russe Michaëlowski, en ce que la tribu iunok la plus voisine de ce
poste, vers le nord, est désignée par nos Tchiglit sous le nom d’
<i>Apkwam-méut</i> ou de Sédentaires; or telle est la position
géographique qui convient aux sédentaires Tchukatches américains, dont
la limite la plus septentrionale, selon le capitaine Beechey, est la
pointe Barrow.”) A&nbsp;slight acquaintance with the work <ins class =

allow it to escape again by the nose and ears(!).” The tobacco is said

Dr. Simpson’s language (op. cit., p. 243) is a little indefinite (“The
feet and legs are incased in water-tight sealskin boots”), but probably
refers to these as well as to the knee boots. The “outside coat of the
same material,” and the boots and outside coat “made all in one, with a
drawing string round the face,” mentioned in the same place, appears to
have gone wholly out of fashion since his time. At all events, we saw
neither, though we continually saw the natives when working in the
boats, and these garments, especially the latter, could hardly have
failed to attract our attention.</p>

Compare the custom observed by H.M.S. <i>Investigator</i>, at Cape
Bathurst, where, according to McClure (Discovery of the Northwest
Passage, p.&nbsp;93), a&nbsp;successful harpooner has a blue line drawn
across his face over the bridge of the nose; or, according to Armstrong
(Personal Narrative, p.&nbsp;176), he has a line tattooed from the inner
angle of the eye across the cheek, a&nbsp;new one being added for every
whale he strikes. Petitot, however (Monographie, etc., p.&nbsp;xxv),
says that in this region whales are “scored” by tattooing crosses on the
shoulder, and that a murderer is marked across the nose with a couple of
horizontal lines. It is interesting to note in this connection that one
of the “striped” men at Nuwŭk told us that he had killed a man.
According to Holm, at Angmagsalik (east Greenland), “Mændene ere kun
undtagelsvis tatoverede og da kun med enkelte mindre Streger paa Arme og
Haandled, for at kunne harpunere godt” (Geogr. Tids., vol. 8,
p.&nbsp;88). Compare also Hooper, Tents, etc., p.&nbsp;37, “Men only
make a permanent mark on the face for an act of prowess, such as killing
a bear, capturing a whale, etc.;” and Parry, 2d Voyage, p.&nbsp;449,
where some of the men at Iglulik are said to be tattooed on the back of
the hand, as a souvenir of some distant or deceased person.</p>

of their hands, whereupon they lay a colour, which continueth dark
azurine” (p.&nbsp;627). Hakluyt’s Voyages, etc., 1589.</p>
