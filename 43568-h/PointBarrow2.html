<p>All the men are now supplied with excellent knives of civilized
manufacture, mostly butcher knives or sheath knives of various patterns,
which they employ for numerous purposes, such as skinning and butchering
game, cutting up food, and rough whittling. Fine whittling and carving
is usually done with the “crooked knife,” to be described further on. In
whittling the knife is grasped so that the blade projects on the ulnar
side of the hand and is drawn toward the workman. A&nbsp;pocketknife, of
which they have many of various patterns, is used in the same way.
I&nbsp;observed that the Asiatic Eskimo at Plover Bay held the knife in
the same manner. Capt. Lyon, in describing a man whittling
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page151" id = "page151">
151</a></span>
at Winter island, says: “As is customary with negroes, he cut toward the
left hand and never used the thumb of the right, as we do, for a check
to the knife.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag273" id = "tag273" href =
"#note273">273</a> This apparently refers to a similar manner of holding
the knife. Before the introduction of iron, knives appear to have been
always made of slate, worked by grinding. We obtained twenty-six more or
less complete knives, most of which are genuine old implements, which
have been preserved as heirlooms or amulets. These knives are either
single or double edged, and the double-edged knives may be divided into
four classes, according to their shape. The first class consists of
rather small knives with the edges straight or only slightly curved,
tapering to a sharp or truncated point, with the butt terminating in a
short broad tang slightly narrower than the blade, which is inserted in
the end of a straight wooden haft, at least as long as the blade. The
commonest material is a hard, dark purple slate, though some are of
black or dark gray slate. Of this class we have three complete knives
and five blades without the haft.</p>

</div>

<p>No. 89584 [1107] (figured in Point Barrow Rept., Ethnology, Pl. III,
Fig.&nbsp;3), will represent this class. It is a blade of dark purple
slate, ground smooth, 3.5 inches long, tapering from a width of 1.3
inches at the butt, with curved edges to a sharp point, and beveled on
both faces from the middle line to the edges, and the flat tang is
inserted into a cleft in the end of a straight haft of spruce. The blade
is secured by a whipping of about fifteen turns of sinew braid lodged in
a broad shallow groove round the end of the haft. In a hole in the other
end of the haft is looped a short lanyard of seal thong. Fig.
99<i>a</i>, No. 89581 [1011], is a knife of the same class and about the
same size, having a haft 4 inches and a blade 3 inches long. The blade
is secured by two lashings, of which the first is a narrow strip of
whalebone, and the other of sinew braid. The materials of blade and haft
are the same as before. No. 89585 [1710] (Fig. 99<i>b</i>), has a blade
of dark gray slate, and the haft, which appears to be of cotton wood, is
in two longitudinal sections. The
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page152" id = "page152">
152</a></span>
lashing which holds these two sections together is of braided sinew. Of
the blades, the only sharp-pointed one, No. 56684 [228] (Fig. 100), is
like the blade of 89584 [1107], but rather larger. The others all have
rounded or truncated points and are not over 3½ inches long, including
the tang, but otherwise closely resemble the blades already described.
They all show signs of considerable age and several of them are nicked
and gapped on the edge from use. Knives of this class are not like any
in use at the present day, and it was not possible to learn definitely
whether this shape served any special purpose. We were, however, given
to understand that the sharp-pointed ones were sometimes, at least, used
for stabbing. Perhaps they were used specially for cutting up the
smaller animals.</p>

<p>The second class, of which there are four specimens, is not unlike
the first, but the blade is short and broad, with strongly curved edges,
and always sharp pointed, while the haft is always much longer than the
blade. Instead of being evenly beveled off on both faces from the middle
line to the edges, they are either slightly convex, worked down
gradually to the edge, or flat with narrowly beveled edges. They are all
small knives, the longest being 8.3 inches long, with the blade
projecting 3.1 inches from the haft, and the shortest 4.9 inches, with
the blade projecting only 1.4 inches.</p>

<p>Fig. 101, No. 89583 [1305], is a knife of this class, with the blade
a nearly equilateral triangle (1.4 inches long and 1.3 inches wide at
the base), with a flat wooden haft as wide as the blade and 3½ inches
long, cleft at the tip and lashed with thirteen or fourteen turns of
sinew braid. The holes near the butt of the haft were probably to
receive a lanyard. Fig. 102, No. 89591 [1016], is another form of the
same class. The blade is secured by a single rivet of wood.</p>

</div>

<p>The third class consists of large knives, with long, broad,
lanceolate blades, and short straight hafts. There is only one complete
specimen, No. 89592 [1002], Fig. 103. This has a blade of soft, light
greenish
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page153" id = "page153">
153</a></span>
slate, 6&nbsp;inches long and 2.6 inches broad, with the edges broadly
beveled on both faces. The haft of spruce is in two longitudinal
sections, put together so as to inclose the short tang of the blade, and
is secured by a tight whipping of eighteen turns of fine seal twine, and
painted with red ocher. This knife is new and was made for sale, but is
undoubtedly a correct model of an ancient pattern, as No. 56676 [204]
(Fig. 104), which is certainly ancient, appears to be the blade of just
such a knife. We were told that the latter was intended for cutting
blubber. This perhaps means that it was a whaling knife. Mr. Nelson
brought home a magnificent knife of precisely the same pattern, made of
light green jade.</p>

</div>

<p>The two knives, representing the fourth class, are both new and made
for sale, having blades of soft slate. As we obtained no genuine knives
of this pattern, it is possible that they are merely commercial
fabrications. The two knives are very nearly alike, but the larger, No.
89590 [984] (Fig. 105), is the more carefully made. The blade is of
light greenish gray slate, 6.2 inches long and 2 inches broad, and is
straight nearly to the tip, where it curves to a sharp point, making a
blade like that of the Roman gladius. The haft is a piece sawed out of
the beam of an antler, and has a cleft sawed in one end to receive the
short broad tang of the blade. The whipping is of sinew braid.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 106.&mdash;Large single-edged
slate knife.</p>

<p>The single-edged knives were probably all meant specially for cutting
food, and are all of the same general pattern, varying in size from a
blade only 2½ inches long to one of 7 inches. The blade is generally
more strongly curved along the edge than on the back and is usually
sharp-pointed. It is fitted with a broad tang to a straight haft,
usually shorter than the blade. There are in the collection four
complete knives and five unhafted blades. No. 89597 [1052] (Fig. 106) is
a typical knife of this kind. The blade is of black slate, rather rough,
and is 5.6 inches long (including the tang). The tang, which is about
one-half inch long and the same breadth, is lashed <i>against</i> one
end of the flat haft of bone which is cut away to receive it, with five
turns of stout seal thong. No. 89594 [1053] differs from the preceding
only in having the tang inserted in a cleft in the end of the haft, and
No. 89589<i>a</i>
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page154" id = "page154">
154</a></span>
[1054] has the back more curved than the edge, the haft of antler and
the lashing of whalebone. All three are of very rude workmanship. No.
89587 [1587], is a small knife with a truncated point and the tang
imbedded without lashing in the end of a roughly made haft of bone.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 107.&mdash;Blades of knives.</p>
</div>

<p>Most of the blades are those of knives similar to the type, more
smoothly finished, but No. 56712 [226] (Fig. 107<i>a</i>) is noticeable
for the extreme “belly” of the edge and the smoothness with which the
faces are beveled from back to edge. Such knives approach the woman’s
round knife (ulu, ulu´ra). No. 89601 [776] (Fig. 107<i>b</i>) is almost
double-edged, the back being rounded off. Fig. 108, No. 89631 [1081], is
a very remarkable form of slate knife, of which this was the only
specimen seen. In shape it somewhat resembles a hatchet, having a broad
triangular blade with a strongly curved cutting edge, along the back of
which is fitted a stout haft of bone 12½ inches long. The blade is of
soft, dark purple slate, ground smooth, and resembles the modern knives
in having the sharp cutting edge beveled almost wholly on one face. The
haft is the foreshaft of an old whale harpoon, and is made of whale’s
bone. The back of the blade is fitted into a deep narrow saw cut, and
held on by three very neat lashings of narrow strips of whalebone, each
of which passes through a hole drilled through the blade close to the
haft and through a pair of vertical holes in the haft on each side of
the blade. These holes converge towards the back of the haft and are
joined by a deep channel, so that the lashing is countersunk below the
surface of the haft. This implement was brought down from Nuwŭk and
offered for sale as a knife anciently used for cutting off the blubber
of a whale. The purchaser got the impression that it was formerly
attached to a long pole and used like a whale spade. On more careful
examination after our return it was discovered that the haft was really
part of an old harpoon and that the lashings and holes to receive them
were evidently newer than the haft.</p>

<p>It is possible that the blade may have been long ago fitted to the
haft and that the tool may have been used as described. That knives of
this sort were occasionally used by the Eskimo is shown by a specimen in
the Museum from Norton Sound. This is smaller than the one described but
has a slate blade of nearly the same shape and has a haft, for hand use
only, put on in the same way.</p>

<p>With such knives as these the cut is made by <i>drawing</i> the knife
toward the user instead of pushing it away, as in using the round knife.
We found no evidence that these Eskimo ever used knives of ivory (except
for cutting snow) or ivory knives with bits of iron inlaid in the edge,
such as have been observed among those of the East.</p>

blade.</p>

<p>Fig. 109, No. 89477 [1422], is a very extraordinary implement, which
was brought down from Point Barrow and which has evidently been exposed
alongside of some corpse at the cemetery. The blade is a long, flat,
thin piece of whalebone wedged between the two parts of the haft, which
has been sawed lengthwise for 6½ inches to receive it. The haft is a
slender piece of antler. No other specimens of the kind were seen, nor
have similar implements, to my knowledge, been observed elsewhere. The
natives insisted that it was genuine, and was formerly used for cutting
blubber.</p>

<p>I have introduced four figures of old iron or steel knives, of which
we have six specimens, in order to show the way in which the natives in
early days, when iron was scarce, utilized old case-knives and bits of
tools, fitting them with hafts of their own make. All agree in having
the edge beveled on the upper face only. All the knives which they
obtain from the whites at the present day are worked over with a file so
as to bring the bevel on one face only. Fig. 110, No. 89296 [970], from
Nuwŭk, has a blade of iron, and the flat haft is made of two
longitudinal sections of reindeer antler, held together with four large
rivets nearly equidistant. The two which pass through the tang are of
brass and the other two of iron. The blade is 3.6 inches long, the haft
4.1 long and 0.9 broad. Fig. 110, No. 89294 [901], from Utkiavwĭñ, has a
short, thick, and sharp-pointed blade, and is hafted in the same way
with antler, one section of the haft being cut out to receive the short,
thick tang. The first two rivets are of iron, the other three of brass
and not quite long enough to go wholly through the haft. The blade is
barely 2 inches long. Fig. 111<i>a</i>, No. 89297 [1125], from Nuwŭk,
has a short blade, 2½ inches long, and the two sections of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page156" id = "page156">
156</a></span>
haft are held together, not by rivets, but by a close spiral lasting of
stout seal thong extending the whole length of the haft. No. 89293
[1330], Fig. 111<i>b</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ, has a peculiarly shaped blade,
which is a bit of some steel tool imbedded in the end of a straight bit
of antler 4 inches long. One of these knives, not figured, is evidently
part of the blade of an old-fashioned curved case knife. It is stamped
with the name “Wilson,” and underneath this are three figures, of which
only &lt;&gt; can be made out. This may be a table knife bought or
stolen from the <i>Plover</i> in 1852-’54.</p>

<p>There is in the collection one large double-edged knife (Fig. 112,
No. 89298 [1162]) of precisely the same form as the slate hunting knife
(Fig. 103) and Mr. Nelson’s jade knife previously mentioned. The blade
is of thick sheet iron, which has in it a couple of rivet holes, and the
haft of reindeer antler in two sections, held together by a large copper
rivet at each end and a marline of sinew braid. Each edge has a narrow
bevel on one face only, the two edges being beveled on opposite faces.
There are a small number of such knives still in use, especially as
hunting knives (for cutting up walrus, one man said). They are
considered to be better than modern knives for keeping off evil spirits
at night. As is not unusual, the antiquity of the object has probably
invested it with a certain amount of superstitious regard. These knives
are undoubtedly the same as the “double-edged knives (pan´-na)”
mentioned by Dr.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page157" id = "page157">

Simpson (op.&nbsp;cit., p.&nbsp;266) as brought for sale by the
Nunatañmiun, who obtained them from the Siberian natives, and which he
believes to be carried as far as the strait of Fury and Hecla. It would
be interesting to decide whether the stone hunting knives were an
original idea of the Eskimo, or whether they were copies, in stone, of
the first few iron knives obtained from Siberia; but more material is
needed before the matter can be cleared up.</p>

<p>The natives of Point Barrow, in ordinary conversation, call all
knives savĭk, which also means <i>iron</i>, and is identically the same
as the word used in Greenland for the same objects. If, then, there was
a time, as these people say, when their ancestors were totally ignorant
of the use of iron&mdash;and the large number of stone implements still
found among them is strongly corroborative of this&mdash;the use of this
name indicates that the first iron was obtained from the east, along
with the soapstone lamps, instead of from Siberia. Had it first come
from Siberia, as tobacco did, we should expect to find it, like the
latter, called by a Russian or Siberian name.</p>

<p>Like all the Eskimo of North America from Cape Bathurst westward, the
natives of Point Barrow use for fine whittling and carving on wood,
ivory, bone, etc., “crooked knives,” consisting of a small blade, set on
the under side of the end of a long curved haft, so that the edge, which
is beveled only on the upper face, projects about as much as that of a
spokeshave. The curve of blade and haft is such that when the under
surface of the blade rests against the surface to be cut the end of the
haft points up at an angle of about 45°. This knife differs essentially
from the crooked carving knife so generally used by the Indians of North
America. As a rule the latter has only the blade (which is often double
edged) curved and stuck into the end of a straight haft. These knives
are at the present time made of iron or steel and are of <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘two / two’ at line break">two</ins>
sizes, a&nbsp;large knife, mĭ´dlĭñ, with a haft 10 to 20 inches long,
intended for working on wood, and a small one, savigro´n (lit. “an
instrument for shaving”), with a haft 6 or 7 inches long and intended
specially for cutting bone and ivory. Both sizes are handled in the same
way. The knife is held close to the blade between the index and second
fingers of the right hand with the thumb over the edge, which is toward
the workman. The workman draws the knife toward him, using his thumb as
a check to gauge the depth of the cut. The natives use these knives with
very great skill, taking off long and very even shavings and producing
very neat workmanship.<a class = "tag" name = "tag274" id = "tag274"
href = "#note274">274</a></p>

<p>There are in the collection four large knives and thirteen small
ones. No. 89278 [787] (Fig. 113) will serve as the type of the large
knives. The haft is a piece of reindeer antler, flat on one face and
rounded on the other, and the curve is toward the rounded face. The flat
face is hollowed out by cutting away the cancellated tissue from the
bend to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page158" id = "page158">
158</a></span>
the tip, and the lower edge is sloped off so that the end of the haft is
flat and narrow, with a slight twist. The blade is riveted to the flat
face of the haft with three iron rivets, and is a piece of a saw
countersunk flush with the surface of the haft, so that it follows its
curvature. The cutting edge is beveled only on the upper face. The lower
edge of the haft, from the blade to the place where it begins to narrow,
is pierced with eleven equidistant holes, through which is laced a piece
of sealskin thong, the two parts crossing like a shoe-lacing, to prevent
the hand from slipping. The ornamental pattern on the upper face of the
haft is incised and was originally colored with red ocher, but is now
filled with dirt.</p>

<p>Fig. 114, No. 89780 [1004<i>d</i>], is a very long hafted knife (the
haft is 12.3 inches long), but otherwise resembles the type, though not
so elaborately ornamented. The blade is also a bit of a saw. It is
provided with a sheath 3¼ inches long, made of black sealskin with the
black side out, doubled over at one side, and sewed “over and over” down
the other side and round one end. To the open end is sewed a bit of
thong with a slit in the end of it, into which one end of a lanyard of
seal twine 15 inches long is fastened with a becket-hitch. When the
sheath is fitted over the blade the lanyard is passed through a hole in
the haft and made fast by two or three turns around it. Such sheaths are
often used by careful workmen. This particular knife was the property of
the “inlander” Ilû´bwgɐ, previously mentioned. No. 89283 [967], from
Nuwŭk, is interesting as being the only left-handed tool we obtained.
The fourth knife has a blade with a cutting edge of 3½ inches, while

<p>The small knife differs little from the mĭ´dlĭñ except in having the
haft very much shorter and not tapered off at the tip. Fig. 115<i>a</i>,
No. 56552 [145], from Utkiavwĭñ, shows a common form of this kind of
knife, though the blade usually has a sharp point like those of the
large
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page159" id = "page159">

knives, projecting beyond the end of the haft. This knife has a blade of
iron riveted on with two iron rivets to a haft of reindeer antler. The
edges of the haft close to the blade are roughened with crosscuts to
prevent slipping.</p>

<p>The blades of the small knives are frequently inserted into a cleft
in the edge of the haft, as in Fig. 115<i>b</i>, 89632 [827], and 89277
[1172]. The blade, in such cases, is secured by wedging it tightly, with
sometimes the addition of a lashing of thong through a hole in the haft
and round the heel of the blade. The blade is usually of steel, in most
cases a bit of a saw and the haft of reindeer antler, generally plain,
unless the circular hollows, such as are to be seen on No. 89277 [1172],
which are very common, are intended for ornament. Fig. 116, No. 89275
[1183], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a rather peculiar knife. The haft, which is
the only one seen of walrus ivory, is nearly straight, and the unusually
long point of the blade is strongly bent up. The rivets are of copper.
This knife, the history of which we did not obtain, was very likely
meant both for wood and ivory. It is old and rusty and has been long in
use.</p>

<p>All of the crooked knives in the collection are genuine implements
which have been actually in use, and do not differ in type from the
crooked knives in the Museum from the Mackenzie district, Kotzebue
Sound, and other parts of Alaska. Similar knives appear to be used among
the Siberian Eskimo and the Chukches, who have adopted their habits.
Hooper (Tents, etc., p.&nbsp;175), mentions “a&nbsp;small knife with a
bent blade and a handle, generally made of the tip of a deer’s horn,” as
one in general use at Plover Bay, and handled in the same skillful way
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page160" id = "page160">
160</a></span>
as at Point Barrow.<a class = "tag" name = "tag275" id = "tag275" href =
"#note275">275</a> Among the Eskimo of the central region they are
almost entirely unknown. The only mention I have seen of such tools is
in Parry’s Second Voyage (p.&nbsp;504), where he speaks of seeing at
Iglulik “several open knives with crooked wooden handles,” which he
thinks “must have been obtained by communication alongshore with Hudson
Bay.” I&nbsp;can find no specimen, figure, or description of the sa´nat
(“tool”), <i>the</i> tool par excellence of the Greenlanders, except the
following definition in Kleinschmidt’s “Grønlandsk Ordbog”:
“2.&nbsp;Specially a narrow, long-hafted knife, which is sharpened on
one side and slightly curved at the tip (and which is a Greenlander’s
chief tool).” This seems to indicate that this knife, so common in the
West, is equally common in Greenland.<a class = "tag" name = "tag276" id

<p>Whether these people used crooked knives before the introduction of
iron is by no means certain, though not improbable. Fig. 117<i>a</i>,
No. 89633 [1196], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a knife made by imbedding a flake
of gray flint in the lower edge of a haft of reindeer antler, of the
proper shape and curvature for a mĭdlĭñ handle. The haft is soiled and
undoubtedly old, while the flaked surfaces of the flint do not seem
fresh, and the edge shows slight nicks, as if it had been used. Had this
knife been followed by others equally genuine looking, I&nbsp;should
have no hesitation in pronouncing it a prehistoric knife, and the
ancestor of the present steel one. The fact, however, that its purchase
gave rise to the manufacture of a host of flint knives all obviously new
and more and more clumsily made, until we refused to buy any more, leads
me to suspect that it was fabricated with very great care from old
material, and skillfully soiled by the maker.</p>

<p>Ten of these knives of flint were purchased within a fortnight before
we detected the deceit. Fig. 117<i>b</i>, No. 89636 [1212] is one of the
best of these counterfeits, made by wedging a freshly flaked flint blade
into the haft of an old savigrón, which has been somewhat trimmed to
receive the blade and soiled and charred to make it look old. Other more
carelessly made ones had clumsily carved handles of whale’s bone, with
roughly flaked flints stuck into them and glued in with oil dregs. All
of these came from Utkiavwĭñ. Another suspicious circumstance is that a
few days previously two slate-bladed crooked knives had been brought
down from Nuwŭk and accepted without question as ancient. On examining
the specimens since our return, I&nbsp;find that while the hafts are
certainly old, the blades, which are of soft slate easily worked,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page161" id = "page161">
161</a></span>
are as certainly new. Fig. 118<i>a</i>, 118<i>b</i>, represent these two
knives (89580 [1062], 89586 [1061]), which have the blades lashed on
with deer sinew. It is worthy of note in this connection that there are
no stone knives of this pattern in the museum from any other
locality.</p>

<p>The women employ for all purposes for which a knife or scissors could
be used a semicircular knife of the same general type as those described
by every writer from the days of Egede, who has had to deal with the
Eskimo. The knives at the present day are made of steel, usually, and
perhaps always, of a piece of a saw blade, which gives a sheet of steel
of the proper breadth and thickness, and are manufactured by the natives
themselves. Dr. Simpson says<a class = "tag" name = "tag277" id =
"tag277" href = "#note277">277</a> that in his time they were brought
from Kotzebue Sound by the Nunatañmiun, who obtained them from the
Siberian Eskimo. There are in the collection three of these steel
knives, all of the small size generally called ulúrɐ (“little úlu”). No.
56546 [14] has been picked out for description (Fig. 119). The blade is
wedged into a handle of walrus ivory. The ornamentation on the handle is
of incised lines and dots blackened. The cutting edge of the blade is
beveled on one face only. This knife represents the general shape of
knives of this sort, but is rather smaller than most of them.
I&nbsp;have seen some knives with blades fully 5 or 6 inches long and
deep in proportion. The handle is almost always of walrus ivory and of
the shape figured. I&nbsp;do not remember ever seeing an úlu blade
secured otherwise than by fitting it tightly into a narrow slit in the
handle, except in one case, when the handle was part of the original
handle of the saw of which the knife was made, left still riveted
on.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to specify the various purposes for which these
knives are used. Whenever a woman wishes to cut anything, from her food
to a thread in her sewing, she uses an úlu in preference to anything
else. The knife is handled precisely as described among the eastern
Eskimo, making the cut by pushing instead of drawing,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag278" id = "tag278" href = "#note278">278</a> thus differing
from the long-handled round knife mentioned above. Knives of this
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page162" id = "page162">
162</a></span>
pattern are very generally used among the western Eskimo, but in the
east the blade is always separated from the handle by a short shank, as
in our mincing knives.</p>

<p>The natives of Point Barrow used round knives long before the
introduction of iron. There are in the collection twenty-three more or
less complete round knives of stone, most of which are genuine
implements that have been used. Of these a few, which are perhaps the
more recent ones, have blades not unlike the modern steel knife. For
instance, No. 89680 [1106] Fig. 120, has a blade of hard gray mica slate
of almost precisely the modern shape, but both faces are gradually
worked down to the cutting edge without a bevel on either. The handle is
very large and stout and made of coarse whale’s bone. This knife was
said to have come from the ruined village at Pernyɐ. Fig. 121, No. 89679
[971], from Nuwŭk, was made for sale, but is perhaps a model of a form
sometimes used. The shape of the blade is quite different from those now
in use, in having the cutting edge turned so strongly to the front. The
handle is of oak and the blade of rather hard, dark purple slate. Fig.
122, 89689 [985], also from Nuwŭk, and made for the market, is
introduced to show a method of hafting which may have been formerly
employed. The haft is of reindeer antler in two longitudinal sections,
between which the blade is wedged. These two sections are held together
by lashings of sinew at each end, passing through holes in each piece
and round the ends. These lashings being put on wet, have shrunk so that
the blade is very tightly clasped between the two parts of the handle.
The commoner form of these stone knives, however, has the back of the
blade much longer, so that the sides are straight instead of oblique and
usually round off gradually at the ends of the cutting edge without
being produced into a point at either end. No. 89682 [958] is a form
intermediate between this and the modern shape, having a blade with a
long back, but produced into a sharp point at one end. The handle is of
reindeer antler and the blade rather soft black slate. This specimen is
a very cleverly counterfeited antique.</p>

<p>No. 89636 [1122], Fig. 123, approaches yet nearer the ancient shape,
but still has one end slightly produced. The handle is also of reindeer
antler, which seems to have been very commonly used with the slate
blades. The lashing round the blade close to the handle is of seal
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page163" id = "page163">
163</a></span>
thong, with the end wound spirally round all the parts on both sides and
neatly tucked in. It seems to serve no purpose beyond enlarging the
handle so as to make it fit the hand better. One beautiful blade of
light olive green, clouded jade, No. 89675 [1170], belonged to a knife
of this pattern. The older pattern is represented by No. 89676 [1586],
a&nbsp;small knife blade from Ukiavwĭñ, which has been kept as an
amulet. No. 56660 [129], is a blade of the same type, but elongated,
being 7½ inches long and 2 broad. This is a very beautiful implement of
pale olive jade, ground smooth. The bevel along the back of each of
these blades indicates that they were to be fitted into a narrow slit in
a long haft, like that of No. 89684 [886], Fig. 124, from Nuwŭk. Though
both blade and handle of this specimen are very old, and have been put
together in their present shape for a long time, the handle, which is of
whale’s bone, evidently belonged to a longer blade, which fitted in the
cleft without the need of any lashing. Fig. 125, No. 89693 [874], shows
a form of handle evidently of very great antiquity, as the specimen
shows signs of great age. It was purchased from a native of Utkiavwĭñ.
It is made of a single piece of coarse whale’s bone. It was intended for
a blade at least 7 inches long.</p>

<p>Fig. 126, No. 56672 [191], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a very crude, large
knife, intended for use without a handle. It is of rough, hard, dark
purplish slate. The upper three-quarters of both faces are almost
untouched cleavage surfaces, but the lower quarter is pretty smoothly
ground down to a semicircular cutting edge, which is somewhat nicked
from use.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page164" id = "page164">
164</a></span>
The angular grooves on the two faces were evidently begun with the
intention of cutting the knife in two. We were told that this large
knife was specially for cutting blubber. It is a genuine antique.</p>

<p>While ground slate is a quite common material for round knives, flint
appears to have been rarely used. We obtained only three of this
material. No. 89690 [1311] is a flint knife hafted with a rough,
irregular lump of coarse whale’s bone. The blade is a rather thin
“spall” of light gray flint, flaked round the edges into the shape of a
modern ulúrɐ blade, with a very strongly curved cutting edge. Though the
handle is new, the flaking of the blade does not seem fresh, so that it
is possibly a genuine old blade fitted with a new haft for the market.
A&nbsp;similar flint blade, more neatly flaked, was brought from
Kotzebue Sound by Lieut. Stoney, U.S.&nbsp;Navy, in 1884. The other two
flint knives are interesting from being made for use without
handles.</p>

<p>No. 89691 [1360], Fig. 127, from Sidaru, is an oblong, wedge-shaped
spall of gray flint, of which the back still preserves the natural
surface of the pebble. It is slightly shaped by coarse flaking along the
back and one end, and the edge is finely flaked into a curved outline
rounding up at the ends. The specimen is old and dirty, and was probably
preserved as a sort of heirloom or amulet. No. 89692 [1178] is a similar
spall from a round pebble. Such knives as these are evidently the first
steps in the development of the round knife. The shape of the spalls,
produced by breaking a round or oval pebble of flint, would naturally
suggest using them as knives, and the next step would be to improve the
edge by flaking. The greater adaptability of slate, from its softness
and easy cleavage, for making such knives would soon be recognized, and
we should expect to find, as we do, knives like No. 56672 [191]. The
next step would naturally be to provide such a knife with a haft at the
point where the stone was grasped by the hand, while reducing this haft
so as to leave only just enough for the grasp and cutting away the
superfluous corners of the blade would give us the modern form of the
blade. Round knives of slate are not peculiar to Point Barrow, but have
been collected in many other places in northwestern America.<a class =

<p>The relationship between these knives and the semilunar slate blades
found in the North Atlantic States has already been ably discussed by
Dr. Charles Rau.<a class = "tag" name = "tag280" id = "tag280" href =

are sufficiently “fish-cutters” to warrant their admission into a book
on fishing, the cutting of fish is but a small part of the work they do.
The name “fish-cutter,” as applied to these knives, would be no more

<p>Even at the present day the Eskimo of Point Barrow use no tool for
shaping large pieces of woodwork, except a shorthandled adz, hafted in
the same manner as the old stone tools which were employed before the
introduction of iron. Though axes and hatchets are frequently obtained
by trading, they are never used as such, but the head is removed and
rehafted so as to make an adz of it. This habit is not peculiar to the
people of Point Barrow. There is a hatchet head, mounted in the same
way, from the Anderson River, in the Museum collection, and the same
thing was noted in Hudson’s Strait by Capt. Lyon<a class = "tag" name =
"tag282" id = "tag282" href = "#note282">282</a> and at Iglulik by Capt.
Parry.<a class = "tag" name = "tag283" id = "tag283" href =
"#note283">283</a> Mr. L.&nbsp;M. Turner informs me that the Eskimo of
Ungava, on the south side of Hudson’s Strait, who have been long in
contact with the whites, have learned to use axes. The collection
contains two such adzes made from small hatchets. No. 89873 [972], Fig.
128, is the more typical of the two. The blade is the head of a small
hatchet or tomahawk lashed to the haft of oak with a stout thong of seal
hide. The lashing is one piece, and is put on wet and shrunk tightly on.
This tool is a little longer in the haft than those commonly used, and
the shape and material of the haft is a little unusual, it being
generally elliptical in section and made of soft wood.</p>

<p>Fig. 129, No. 56638 [309], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar adz, but the
head has been narrowed by cutting off pieces from the sides (done by
filing part way through and breaking the piece off), and a deep
transverse groove has been cut on the front face near the butt. Part of
the lashing is held in this groove as well as by the eye, the lower half
of which is filled up with a wooden plug. The haft is peculiar in being
a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page166" id = "page166">
166</a></span>
piece of reindeer antler which has been reduced in thickness by sawing
out a slice for 8 inches from the butt and bringing the two parts
together with four stout wooden treenails about 1½ inches apart. This is
preferable to trimming it down to a proper thickness from the surface,
as the latter process would remove the compact tissue of the outside and
expose the soft inside tissue. The whipping of seal thong just above the
flange of the butt helps to give a better grip and, at the same time, to
hold the parts together. As before, there are two large holes for the
lashing. Adzes of this sort are used for all large pieces of wood work,
such as timbers for boats, planks, and beams for houses, etc. After
roughly dressing these out with the adz they are neatly smoothed off
with the crooked knife, or sometimes, of late years, with the plane. The
work of “getting out” the large pieces of wood is almost always done
where the drift log lies on the beach. When a man wants a new stem or
sternpost for his umiak, or a plank to repair his house, he searches
along the beach until he finds a suitable piece of driftwood, which he
claims by putting a mark on it, and sometimes hauls up out of the way of
the waves. Then, when he has leisure to go at the work, he goes out with
his adz and spends the day getting it into shape and reducing it to a
convenient size to carry home, either slung on his back or, if too
large, on a dog-sled. A&nbsp;man seldom takes the trouble to carry home
more of a piece of timber than he actually needs for the purpose in
hand.</p>

<p>The adz was in general use long before the introduction of iron.
There is in the collection a very interesting series of ancient tools,
showing the gradual development of the implement from a rude oblong
block of stone worked down to a cutting edge on one end, to the steel
adzes of the present day. They have, however, not even yet learned to
make an eye in the head of the tool in which to insert the haft, but all
tools of this class&mdash;adzes, hammers, picks, and mattocks&mdash;are
lashed, with one face resting against the expanded end of the haft.
Firmness is obtained by putting the lashing on wet and allowing it to
shrink tight. Nearly all these ancient adzes are of jade,
a&nbsp;material well adapted for the purpose by its hardness, which,
however, renders
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page167" id = "page167">
167</a></span>
it difficult to work. Probably the oldest of these adzes is No. 56675
[69], Fig. 130, which has been selected as the type of the earliest form
we have represented in the collection. This is of dark olive green,
almost black, jade, 7.2 inches long, 2.8 wide, and 1.3 thick, and
smoothly ground on the broader faces. The cutting edge is much broken
from long use. One broad face is pretty smoothly ground, but left rough
at the butt end. The other is rather flatter, but more than half of it
is irregularly concave, the natural inequalities being hardly touched by
grinding. Like the other dark-colored jade tools, this specimen is very
much lighter on a freshly fractured surface. The dark color is believed
to be due to long contact with greasy substances.</p>

<p>No. 89662 [900], from Nuwŭk, is an exceedingly rough adz of similar
shape, but so slightly ground that it is probably one that was laid
aside unfinished. From the battered appearance of the ends it seems to
have been used for a hammer. It is of the same dark jade as the
preceding. No. 89689 [792], from Utkiavwĭñ, is of rather light olive,
opaque jade and a trifle better finished than the type, while No. 89661
[1155], Fig. 131, also from Utkiavwĭñ, is a still better piece of
workmanship, the curve of the faces to the cutting edge being very
graceful. The interesting point about this specimen is that a straight
piece has been cut off from one side by sawing down smoothly from each
face almost to the middle and breaking the piece off. We were informed
that this was done to procure rods of jade for making knife sharpeners.
We were informed that these stones were cut in the same way as marble
and freestone are cut with us, namely, by sawing with a flat blade of
iron and sand and water. A&nbsp;thin lamina of hard bone was probably
used before the introduction of iron. Possibly a reindeer scapula, cut
like the one made
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page168" id = "page168">

into a saw (No.&nbsp;89476 [1206], Fig. 147), but without teeth, was
used for this purpose.</p>

<p>That such stone blades were used with a haft is shown by the only
hafted specimen, No. 56628 [214], Fig. 132, from Nuwŭk. This is a rather
small adz. The head of dark green jade differs from those already
described only in dimensions, being 4 inches long, 2.1 wide, and 1.7
thick. The haft is of reindeer antler and in shape much like that of No.
56638 [309], but has only one hole for the lashing. The lashing is of
the usual stout seal thong and put on in the usual fashion. No. 89673
[1423] is an old black adz from Sidaru of the same pattern as those
described, but very smoothly and neatly made. About one-half of this
specimen has been cut off for whetstones, etc.</p>

<p>The next step is to make the lashing more secure by cutting
transverse grooves on the upper face of the head to hold the thong in
place. This has been done on No. 56667 [215], figured in Point Barrow
Rept., Ethnology, Pl. <span class = "smallroman">II</span>, Fig. 5, an
adz of dark olive green jade, from Utkiavwĭñ, which shows two such
grooves, broad and shallow, running across the upper face. Of these two
classes the collection contains thirteen unhafted specimens and one
hafted specimen, all of jade. As cutting these grooves in the stone is a
laborious process, the device of substituting some more easily worked
substance for the back part of the head would naturally suggest
itself.</p>

<p>Fig. 133, No. 89658 [1072], from Utkiavwĭñ, has a long blade of black
stone with the butt slightly tapered off and imbedded in a body of
whale’s bone, which has a channel 1 inch wide, for the lashing, cut
round
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page169" id = "page169">
169</a></span>
it and a shallow socket on the face to receive the end of the haft. Adz
heads of this same type continued in use till after the introduction of
iron, which was at first utilized by inserting a flat blade of iron into
just such a body, as is shown in Fig. 134 (No.&nbsp;89877 [752], from
the cemetery at Utkiavwĭñ).</p>

<p>From this type to that shown in Fig. 135 (No. 89876 [696] brought by
the natives from the ruins on the Kulugrua) the transition is easy.
Suppose, for the greater protection of the lashings, we <i>inclose</i>
the channels on the sides of the head&mdash;in other words, bore holes
instead of cutting grooves&mdash;we have exactly this pattern, namely,
vertical eyes on each side of the head joined by transverse channels on
the upper face. The specimen figured has on each side two oblong slots
with a round eye between them. The blade is of iron, Fig. 136, No. 56640
[260] has two eyes on each side, and shows a different method of
attaching the blade, which is countersunk flush with the upper surface
of the body and secured with three stout iron rivets. The next step is
to substitute horizontal eyes for the vertical ones, so as to have only
one set of holes to thread the lashings through. This is seen in No.
89869 [878], Fig. 137, from Nuwŭk, which in general pattern closely
resembles No. 89876 [696], but has three large horizontal eyes instead
of the vertical ones. The blade is of iron and the haft of whale’s bone.
The lashing is essentially the same as that of the modern adz, No. 56638
[309].</p>

<p>That this final type of hafting was reached before stone had gone out
of use for such implements is shown by Fig. 138, No. 89839 [769], from
Utkiavwĭñ, which, while very like the last in shape, has a blade
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page170" id = "page170">
170</a></span>
of hard, dark purple slate. The haft is of reindeer antler. The lashing
has the short end <i>knotted</i> to the long part after making the first
round, instead of being slit to receive the latter. Otherwise it is of
the usual pattern. These composite adzes of bone and stone or iron
seemed to have been common at the end of the period when stone was
exclusively used and when iron first came into use in small quantities,
and a good many have been preserved until the present day. We obtained
four hafted and six unhafted specimens, besides seven jade blades for
such composite adzes, which are easily recognizable by their small size
and their shape. They are usually broad and rather thin, and narrowed to
the butt, as is seen in Fig. 139, No. 56685 [71], a&nbsp;beautiful
little adz of bright green jade 2.8 inches long and 2.3 wide, from
Utkiavwĭñ. No. 56670 [246] also from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar blade of
greenish jade slightly larger, being 3.4 inches long and 2 inches wide.
No. 89670 [1092] is a tiny blade of hard, fine-grained black stone,
probably oil-soaked jade, only 1.7 inches long and 1.5 wide. It is very
smoothly ground. Such little adzes, we were told, were especially used
for cutting bone. The implement,<a class = "tag" name = "tag284" id =
"tag284" href = "#note284">284</a> which <ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads ‘Nordenskjöld’">Nordenskiöld</ins> calls a “stone chisel,”
found in the ruins of an old Eskimo house at Cape North, is evidently
the head of one of these little bone adzes, as is plainly seen on
comparing this figure with the larger adzes figured above.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 138.&mdash;Hafted bone and stone

<p>I have figured two more composite adzes, which are quite different
from the rest. No. 89838 [1109], Fig. 140, has a blade of neatly flaked
gray flint, but this as well as the unusually straight haft is newly
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page171" id = "page171">
171</a></span>
made. These are fitted to a very old bone body, which when whole was not
over 3 inches long, and was probably part of a little bone adz. There is
no evidence that these people ever used flint adzes. Fig. 141, No. 89872
[785], is introduced to show how the native has utilized an old cooper’s
adz, of which the eye was probably broken, by fitting it with a bone
body.</p>

<p>While the adzes already described appear to have been the
predominating types, another form was sometimes used. Fig. 142, No.
89874 [964], from Nuwŭk, represents this form. The haft is of whale’s
rib, 1&nbsp;foot long, and the head of <i>bone</i>, apparently whale’s
scapula, 5.6 inches long and 2.8 inches wide on the edge. There is an
adze in the Museum from the Mackenzie River region with a <i>steel</i>
blade of precisely the same pattern. That adzes of this pattern
sometimes had stone blades is probable. No. 89840 [1317], is a clumsily
made <i>commercial</i> tool of this type, with a small head of greenish
slate. It has an unusually straight haft, which is disproportionately
long and thick.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 141.&mdash;Old cooper’s adz,
rehafted.</p>

<p>All these adzes, ancient and modern, are hafted upon essentially the
same pattern. The short curved haft, the shape of which is sufficiently
well indicated by the figures, seems to have been generally made of
whale’s rib or reindeer antler, both of which have a natural curve
suited
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page172" id = "page172">
172</a></span>
to the shape of the haft. A&nbsp;“branch” of a reindeer’s antler is
particularly well suited for the haft of a small adze. Not only does it
have naturally the proper dimensions and a suitable curve, but it is
very easy, by cutting out a small segment of the “beam” where the
“branch” starts from it, to make a flange of a convenient shape for
fitting to the head. Antler is besides easily obtained, not only when
the deer is killed for food, but by picking up shed antlers on the
tundra, and is consequently employed for many purposes. The haft usually
has a knob at the tip to keep the hand from slipping, and the grip is
sometimes roughened with cross cuts or wound with thong. There are
usually as many holes for the lashing as there are eyes in the head,
though there are two holes when the head has only one large eye. On the
bone heads, the surfaces to which the haft is applied and the channels
for the lashings are roughened with cross cuts to prevent slipping. The
lashing always follows the same general plan, though no two adzes are
lashed exactly alike. The plan may be summarized as follows: One end of
the thong makes a turn through one of the holes in the haft, and around
or through the head. This turn is then secured, usually by passing the
long end through a slit in the short end and hauling this loop taut,
sometimes by knotting the short end to the long part, or by catching the
short end down under the next turn. The long part then makes several
turns round or through the head and through the haft, sometimes also
crossing around the latter, and the whole is then finished off by
wrapping the end two or three times around the turns on one side and
tucking it neatly underneath. This is very like the method of lashing on
the heads of the mauls already described, but the mauls have only one
hole in the haft, and there are rarely any turns around the latter.</p>

<p>We collected a number of small short handled chisels, resembling the
implements called “trinket makers,” of which there are so many in the
National Museum. We never happened to see them in actual use, but were
informed that they were especially designed for working
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page173" id = "page173">

on reindeer antler. Of the eight specimens collected No. 89302 [884],
Fig. 143, has been selected as a type of the antler chisel (kĭ´ñnusa).
The blade is of steel, and the haft is of reindeer antler, in two
longitudinal sections, put together at right angles to the plane of the
blade, held together by a stout round bone treenail 2½ inches from the
butt. The square tip of the blade is beveled on both faces to a rough
cutting edge. Fig. 144 (No.&nbsp;89301) [1000] has a small blade with an
oblique tip <i>not</i> beveled to an edge, and a haft of walrus ivory
yellowed from age, and ornamented with rows of rings, each with a dot in
the center, all incised and colored with red ocher. The two parts of the
haft are fastened together by a stout wooden treenail and a
<i>stitch</i> of whalebone.</p>

<p>The rest of the steel-bladed chisels, four in number, are all of
about the same size and hafted with antler. The blades are somewhat
irregular in shape, but all have square or oblique tips and no sharp
edge. Three of them have the sections of the haft put together as
described, and fastened by a treenail and a whipping of seal twine or
sinew braid at the tip. One has the two sections put together in the
plane of the blade and fastened with a large copper rivet, which also
passes through the butt of the blade, and three stout iron ones. The
hafts of all these tools show signs of much handling. The remaining two
specimens have blades of black flint. No. 89637 [1207], has a haft of
walrus ivory, of the usual pattern, fastened together by a bone treenail
and two stitches, one of sinew braid and one of seal thong. The lashing
of seal twine near the tip serves to mend a crack. The haft is old and
rusty about the slot into which the blade is fitted, showing that it
originally had an iron blade. The flint blade was probably put in to
make it seem ancient, as there was a special demand for prehistoric
articles. No. 89653 [1290], Fig. 145, is nothing but a fanciful tool
made to meet this demand. The haft is of light-brown mountain sheep
horn, and the blade of black flint. Such flint-bladed tools may have
been used formerly, but there is no proof that they were.</p>

shaves.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>There is in use at Point Barrow, and apparently not elsewhere among
the Eskimo, a&nbsp;special tool for shaving whalebone, a&nbsp;substance
which is very much used in the form of long, thin strips for fastening
together boat timbers, whipping spear shafts, etc. The
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page174" id = "page174">
174</a></span>
thin, long shavings which curl up like “curled hair,” are carefully
saved and used for the padding between stocking and boot. Whalebone is
also sometimes shaved for this special purpose. The tool is essentially
a little spokeshave about 4 inches long, which is held by the index and
second finger of the right hand, one on each handle, with the thumb
pressed against one end, and is drawn toward the workman. The collection
contains three specimens of the ordinary form (sávigɐ), represented by
No. 89306 [885] (figured in Point Barrow Report, Ethnology, Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">III</span>, Fig.&nbsp;6). This has a steel blade
and a haft of walrus ivory. The upper face of the haft is convex and the
under flat, and the blade, which is beveled only on the upper face, is
set at a slight inclination to the flat face of the haft. The edge of
the blade projects 0.2 inch from the haft above and 0.3 below. The hole
at one end of the haft is for a lanyard to hang it up by. The other two
are of essentially the same pattern, but have hafts of reindeer
antler.</p>

<p>The collection also contains six tools of this description, with
stone blades, but they are all new and very carelessly made, with hafts
of coarse-grained bone. The shape of the tools is shown in Fig. 146, No.
89649 [1213], from Utkiavwĭñ, which has a rough blade of soft, light
greenish slate. The other five have blades of black or gray flint,
roughly flaked. All these blades are glued in with oil dregs. No. 89652
[1225] is like the others in shape, but more neatly made, and is
peculiar in having a blade of hard, compact bone. This is inserted by
sawing a deep, narrow slit along one side of the haft from end to end.
The blade is wedged into the middle of the slit, the ends of which are
neatly filled in with slips of the same material as the haft. This was
the only tool of the kind seen. It is very probable that shaves of stone
were formerly used, though we obtained no genuine specimens. The use of
oblong chips of flint for this purpose would naturally suggest itself to
a savage, and the convenience of fitting these flakes into a little haft
would soon occur to him. No. 89616 [1176] is such an oblong flint,
flaked to an edge on one face, which is evidently old, and which was
said to have been used for shaving whalebone. The material is black
flint. Whalebone is often shaved nowadays with a common knife. The slab
of bone is laid upon the thigh and the edge of the knife pressed firmly
against it, with the blade perpendicular to the surface of the slab,
which is drawn rapidly under it.</p>

found the natives of Iglulik, in 1821-1823, using a saw made of a
notched piece of iron. On our asking Nĭkawa´alu, one day, what they had
for tools before they got iron he said that they had drills made of seal
bones and saws made of the shoulder blade of the reindeer. Some time
afterwards he brought over a model of such a saw, which he said was
exactly like those formerly used. Fig. 147, No. 89476 [1206], represents
this specimen. It is made by cutting off the anterior edge of a
reindeer’s scapula in a straight line parallel to the posterior edge and
cutting fine saw teeth on this thin edge. The spine is also cut off
nearly flat. This makes a tool very much like a carpenter’s backsaw, the
narrow part of the scapula forming a convenient handle.</p>

drill is a slender rod of steel worked to a drill point and imbedded in
a stout wooden shaft, which is tapered to a rounded tip. This fits into
a stone socket imbedded in a wooden block, which is held between the
teeth, so that the point of the drill can be pressed down against the
object to be drilled by the head, leaving both hands free to work the
short bow, which has a loose string of thong long enough to make one
turn round the shaft. The collection contains ten of these modern steel
or iron drills, fifteen bows, and seven mouthpieces. No. 89502 [853],
figured in Point Barrow Rept., Ethnology, Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">II</span>, Fig. 1, has been selected as a typical drill
(niă´ktun). The drill is a cylindrical rod of steel beaten out into a
small lanceolate point, which is filed sharp on the edges. The shaft is
made of hard wood. The remaining drills are of essentially the same
pattern, varying in total length from about 11 inches to 16½.</p>

<p>Fig. 149, No. 89499 [968] shows a somewhat unusual shape of shaft.
The lashings round the large end are to keep it from splitting any more
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page176" id = "page176">
176</a></span>
than it has done already. The drill is of iron and the shaft of spruce,
which was once painted with red ocher.</p>

<p>No. 89497 [819] (Fig. 150) has a ferrule of coarse-grained bone
neatly pegged on with two small pegs of the same material. This is
unusual with steel drills. The shaft is of spruce and of the same shape
as in the preceding specimen. No. 89595 [875] (Fig. 151) is figured to
show the way in which the shaft has been mended. A&nbsp;wedge-shaped
piece 3½ inches long and 0.3 to 0.4 inch wide has been split out of the
large end and replaced by a fresh piece of wood neatly fitted in and
secured by two tight whippings of sinew braid, each in a deep
groove.</p>

<p>No. 89515 [861], figured in Point Barrow Report, Ethnology, Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">II</span>, Fig. 2, is a typical bow (pizĭksuá) for
use with these drills. It is of walrus ivory, 16 inches long and oval in
section. Through each end is drilled a transverse hole. A&nbsp;string of
seal thong 21 inches long is looped into one of these holes by passing
one end of the thong through the hole, cutting a slit in it, and passing
the other end through this. The other end is passed through the other
hole and knotted at the tip.</p>

<p>These bows vary slightly in dimensions, but are not less than a foot
or more than 16 inches long, and are almost always of walrus ivory. No.
89508 [956] (Fig. 152), is an old and rudely made bow of whalebone,
which is more strongly arched than usual, and has the string attached to
notches at the ends instead of into holes. This was said to belong with
an old bone drill, No. 89498 [956]. Both came from Nuwŭk. These bows are
often highly ornamented both by carving and with incised patterns
colored with red ocher or soot. The following figures are introduced to
show some of the different styles of ornamentation.</p>

<p>Fig. 153<i>a</i>, No. 56506 [298] is unusually broad and flat and was
probably made for a handle to a tool bag. Such handles, however, appear
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page177" id = "page177">
177</a></span>
to be also used for drill bows. The tips of this bow represent seals
heads, and have good sized sky-blue glass beads inserted for eyes. The
rest of the ornamentation is incised and blackened. Fig. 153<i>b</i>,
No. 89421 [1260], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar bow, which has incised on
the back figures of men and animals, which, perhaps, tell of some real
event. Mr. L.&nbsp;M. Turner informs me that the natives of Norton Sound
keep a regular record of hunting and other events engraved in this way
upon their drill bows, and that no one ever ventures to falsify these
records. We did not learn definitely that such was the rule at Point
Barrow, but we have one bag-handle marked with whales, which we were
told indicated the number killed by the owner. Fig. 153<i>c</i>, No.
89425 [1732], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar bow, ornamented on the back
with simply an incised border colored red. On the other side are the
figures of ten bearded seals, cross-hatched and blackened. These are
perhaps a “score.” Fig. 153<i>d</i>, No. 89509 [914], from Nuwŭk, is a
bow of the common pattern, but ornamented by carving the back into a
toothed keel.</p>

<p>Fig. 153<i>e</i>, No. 89510 [961], from Utkiavwĭñ, is ornamented on
one side only with an incised pattern, which is blackened. Fig.
153<i>f</i>, No. 89511 [961], also from Utkiavwĭñ, has, in addition to
the incised and blackened pattern, a&nbsp;small transparent sky-blue
glass bead inlaid in the middle of the back. Fig. 153<i>g</i>, No. 89512
[836], from the same place, is a flat bow with the edges carved into
scallops. The incised line along the middle of the back is colored with
red ocher. The string is made of sinew braid.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 152.&mdash;Drill bow.</p>

<p>Fig. 154, No. 89777 [1004<i>b</i>], which belongs in the “kit” of
Ilû´bw’ga, the Nunatañmiun, previously mentioned, is interesting from
having been lengthened 3¼ inches by riveting on a piece of reindeer
antler at one end. The two pieces are neatly joined in a “lap splice”
about 2 inches long and fastened with three iron rivets. The owner
appears to have concluded that his drill bow was too short when he was
at home, in the interior, where he could obtain no walrus ivory. The
incised pattern on the back is colored with red ocher.</p>

<p>The mouthpiece (kĭ´ñmia) consists of a block of hard stone (rarely
iron), in which is hollowed out a round cup-like socket, large enough to
receive the tip of the drill shaft, imbedded in a block of wood of a
suitable size to hold between the teeth. This block often has curved
flanges
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page178" id = "page178">
178</a></span>
on each side, which rest against the cheeks. Such mouthpieces are common
all along the coast from the Anderson River to Norton Sound, as is shown
by the Museum collection. No. 89500 [800], figured in Point Barrow
Report, Ethnology, Pl. <span class = "smallroman">II</span>, Fig. 3, is
a type of the flanged mouthpiece. The block is of pine, carved into a
thick, broad arch, with a large block on the inside. Into the top of the
arch is inlaid a piece of gray porphyry with black spots, which is
slightly convex on the surface, so as to project a little above the
surface of the wood. In the middle of the stone is a cup-shaped cavity
one-half inch in diameter and of nearly the same depth. This is a rather
large mouthpiece, being 6 inches across from one end of the arch to the
other.</p>

<p>There are two other specimens of the same pattern, both rather
smaller. No. 89503 [891], Fig. 150, from Nuwŭk, has the stone of black
and white syenite. This specimen is very old and dirty, and worn through
to the stone on one side, where the teeth have come against it. No.
89787 [1004<i>c</i>], Fig. 155, is almost exactly the same shape as the
type, but has
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page179" id = "page179">
179</a></span>
for a socket a piece of iron 1.1 inches square, hollowed out as usual.
The outside of the wood has been painted with red ocher, but this is
mostly worn off. This mouthpiece belonged to Ilû´bw’ga.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 156, No. 89505 [892], from Utkiavwĭñ, represents the pattern
which is perhaps rather commoner than the preceding. The wood, which
holds the socket of black and white syenite, is simply an elliptical
block of spruce. The remaining three specimens are of the same pattern
and of the same material as the last, except No. 89507 [908], from
Nuwŭk, in which the wood is oak. As it appears very old, this wood may
have come from the <i>Plover</i>.</p>

<p>When not in use, the point of the drill is sometimes protected with a
sheath. One such sheath was obtained, No. 89447 [1112], figured in Point
Barrow Report, Ethnology, Pl. <span class = "smallroman">II</span>,
Fig.&nbsp;1. It is of walrus ivory, 3-6 inches long. The end of a piece
of thong is passed through the eye and the other part fastened round the
open end with a marline-hitch, catching down the end. This leaves a
lanyard 9¼ inches long, which is hitched or knotted round the shaft of
the drill when the sheath is fitted over the point.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 157.&mdash;Bone-pointed drill.</p>
</div>

<p>The drills above described are used for perforating all sorts of
material, wood, bone, ivory, metal, etc., and are almost the only boring
implements used, even awls being unusual. Before the introduction of
iron, the point was made of one of the small bones from a seal’s leg. We
obtained four specimens of these bone drills, of which two, at least,
appear to be genuine. No. 89498 [956], Fig. 157, is one of these, from
Nuwŭk. The shaft is of the ordinary pattern and made of some hard wood,
but the point is a roughly cylindrical rod of bone, expanding at the
point, where it is convex on one face and concave on the other and
beveled on both faces into two cutting edges, which meet in an acute
angle. The larger end of the shaft has been split and mended by whipping
it for about three-quarters of an inch with sinew braid. No. 89518
[1174], is apparently also genuine, and is like the preceding, but
beveled only on the concave face of the point, which is rather obtuse.
No. 89519 [1258] was made for the market. It has a rude shaft of whale’s
bone, but a carefully made bone point of precisely the pattern of the
modern iron ones. No. 89520 [1182] has no shaft, and appears to be an
old unfinished drill fitted into a carelessly made bone ferrule.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page180" id = "page180">
180</a></span>
<p>The drill at the present day is always worked with a bow, which
allows one hand to be used for steadying the piece of work. We were
informed, however, that formerly a cord was sometimes used without the
bow, but furnished with a transverse handle at each end.</p>

<p>We collected six little handles of ivory, carved into some ornamental
shape, each with an eye in the middle to which a thong could be
attached. All were old, and we never saw them in use. The first two were
collected at an early period of our acquaintance with these people, and
from our imperfect knowledge of the language we got the impression that
they were handles to be attached to a harpoon line.</p>

<p>We were not long, however in finding out that the harpoon has no such
appendage, and when the other four came in a year later, at a time when
the press of other work prevented careful inquiry into their use, we
supposed that they were meant for handles to the lines used for dragging
dead seals, as they somewhat resemble such an implement. On our return
home, when I had opportunities for making a careful study of the
collection, I&nbsp;found that none of the drag lines, either in our own
collection or in those of the Museum, had handles of this description.
On the other hand, I&nbsp;found many similar implements in Mr. Nelson’s
collection labeled “drill-cord handles,” and finally one pair
(No.&nbsp;36319, from Kashunuk, near Cape Romanzoff), still attached to
the drill cord. These handles are almost identical in shape with No.
89458 [835], from Utkiavwĭñ. This leaves no doubt in my mind that the
so-called “drag-line handles” in our collection are nothing more than
handles for drill cords, now wholly obsolete and supplanted by the bows
already described. I&nbsp;have figured all six of these handles to show
the different patterns of ornamentation. They are all made of walrus
ivory, and are all “odd” handles, no two being mates. Fig. 158<i>a</i>
(No.&nbsp;56526) [86], is 5.2 inches long, and light blue beads are
inserted for eyes in the seal’s heads. The eye for the drill cord is
made by boring two median holes at the middle of one side so that they
meet under the surface and make a longitudinal channel.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 158<i>b</i> (No. 56527 [23] from Utkiavwĭñ), is 4.3 inches long,
and is very accurately carved into the image of a man’s right leg and
foot, dressed in a striped deerskin boot. The end opposite to the foot
is the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page181" id = "page181">
181</a></span>
head of some animal, perhaps a wolf, with bits of dark wood inlaid for
eyes. The eye is a simple large transverse hole through the thigh.</p>

<p>Fig. 158<i>c</i> (No. 89455 [929] from Nuwŭk), is 5.9 inches long.
The eye is drilled lengthwise through a large lump projecting from the
middle of one side. Small blue beads are inlaid for the eyes, and one to
indicate the male genital opening.</p>

<p>Fig. 158<i>d</i> (No. 89456 [930] from Nuwŭk) is like No. 56527 [23],
but represents the left foot and is not so artistically carved. It is
3.7 inches long.</p>

<p>Fig. 158<i>e</i> (No. 89457 [925] from Nuwŭk) is 4.7 inches long, and
resembles No. 89455 [929], but has instead of the seal’s tail and
flippers a large ovoid knob ornamented with incised and blackened rings.
The “eye” is bored transversely.</p>

<p>Fig. 158<i>f</i> (No. 89458 [835] from Utkiavwĭñ) differs from No.
89455 [925] in having a transverse eye, and being less artistically
carved. Bits of lead are inlaid for the eyes. It is 4.4 inches long. The
name of this implement is kû´ñ-i.</p>

<p>We obtained six specimens of an old flint tool, consisting of a
rather long thick blade mounted in a straight haft about 10 inches long,
of which we had some difficulty in ascertaining the use. We were at last
able to be quite sure that they were intended for drilling, or rather
reaming out, the large cavity in the base of the ivory head of a whale
harpoon, which fits upon the conical tip of the fore-shaft. The shape of
the blade is well fitted for this purpose. It is not unlikely that such
tools, worked as these are, by hand, preceded the bone drills for boring
all sorts of objects, and that the habit of using them for making the
whale harpoon was kept up from the same conservatism founded on
superstition which surrounds the whole whale fishery. (See under “Whale
fishing,” where the subject will be more fully discussed.) No. 89626
[870], figured in Point Barrow Report, Ethnology, Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">II</span>, Fig. 4, is a typical implement of this class
(ītaun, i´tûgetsau´). The blade is of black flint, flaked, 2&nbsp;inches
long, imbedded in the end of a haft of spruce, 10.5 inches long. The
blade is held in place by whipping the cleft end of the haft with sinew
braid.</p>

<p>Two of the other specimens, No. 89627 [937] and No. 89628 [912], are
of essentially the same pattern and material, but have rounded hafts.
No. 89629 [960] and No. 89630 [1068], Figs. 159<i>a</i>, 159<i>b</i>,
have blades of the same pattern, but have hafts fitted for use with the
mouthpiece and bow, showing that sometimes, at least in later times,
these tools were so used. No. 89625 [1217] (Fig. 160) has no haft, but
the blade, which is rather narrow in proportion to its length (2.3
inches by 0.5), is fitted into a short ferrule of antler, with a little
dovetail on the edge for attaching it to the haft.</p>

<p>Of awls we saw only one specimen, which, perhaps, ought rather to be
considered a little hand drill. This is No. 89308 [1292], Fig. 161, from
Utkiavwĭñ. The point is the tip of a common three-cornered file,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page182" id = "page182">
182</a></span>
sharpened down. It is imbedded in a handle of fossil ivory which has
turned a light yellowish brown from age. Its total length is 2.8
inches.</p>

<p>At the present day nearly every man has been able to procure an iron
hammer of some kind, which he uses with great handiness. Before the
introduction of iron, in addition to the bone and stone mauls above
described as bone crushers, unhafted pebbles of convenient shape were
also employed. No. 56661 [274] is such a stone. It is an ovoid
water-worn pebble of greenish gray quartzite, 3½ inches long. The ends
are battered, showing how it had been used. It was brought from one of
the rivers in the interior by one of the natives of Utkiavwĭñ.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "implements_tools_files" id =

<p>Files of all kinds are eagerly sought after by the natives, who use
them with very great skill and patience, doing nearly all their metal
work with these tools. For instance, one particularly ingenious native
converted his Winchester rifle from a rim fire to a central fire with
nothing but a file. To do this he had to make a new firing pin, as the
firing pin of the rim-fire gun is too short to reach the head of the
cartridge. He accomplished this by accurately cutting off, to the proper
length, an old worn-out three-cornered file. He then filed off enough of
each edge so that the rod fitted evenly in the cylindrical hole where
the firing pin works. The work was done so carefully that the new firing
pin worked perfectly, and he had only to complete the job by cutting off
his central fire cartridge shells to a proper length to fit the chamber
of the gun.</p>

<p>They have almost no knowledge of working metal with the aid of heat,
as is natural from the scarcity of fuel. I&nbsp;have, however, seen them
roughly temper small articles, such as fire steels, etc., by heating
them in the fire and quenching them in cold
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page183" id = "page183">
183</a></span>
water. One native very neatly mended a musket barrel which had been
cracked by firing too heavy a charge. He cut a section from another old
barrel of somewhat larger caliber, which he heated until it had expanded
enough to slip down over the crack, and then allowed it to shrink
on.</p>

<p>Knives are generally sharpened with a file, cutting a bevel, as
before mentioned, on one face of the blade only. To “set” or “turn” the
edge they use pieces of steel of various shapes, generally with a hole
drilled in them so that they can be hung to the breeches belt by a
lanyard. One man, for instance, used about half of a razor blade for
this purpose, and another a small horseshoe magnet. In former times they
employed a very elegant implement, consisting of a slender rod of jade
from 3 to 7 inches long, with a lanyard attached to an eye in the larger
end. These were sometimes made by cutting a piece from one of the old
jade adzes in the manner already described. There are a few of these
whetstones still in use at the present day, and they are very highly
prized. We succeeded in obtaining nine specimens, of which No. 89618
[801], Fig. 162<i>a</i>, has been selected as the type. It is of hard
black stone, probably jade, 6.3 inches long. Through the wider end is
drilled a large eye, into which is neatly spliced one end of a stout
flat braid of sinew 4¾ inches long.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page184" id = "page184">

<p>The remaining whetstones are of very much the same pattern.
I&nbsp;have figured five of them, to show the slight variations. Fig.
162<i>b</i> (No.&nbsp;56662 [393], from Utkiavwĭñ) is of light grayish
green jade, smoothly polished and 4.1 inches long. It is chamfered only
on the small end at right angles to the breadth, and has the eye
prolonged into ornamental grooves on the two opposite faces. The long
lanyard is of common sinew braid. No. 56663 [229] (from the same
village) is of olive green, slightly translucent jade, 6.8 inches long,
and elliptical in section, also chamfered only at the small end. The
lanyard, which is a strip of seal thong 9 inches long, is secured in the
eye, as described before, with two slits, one in the standing part
through which the end is passed and the other in the end with the
standing part passed through it. No. 89617 [1262] (from Sidaru) is of
olive green, translucent jade, 6.1 inches long, and shaped like the
type, but chamfered only at the small end. The lanyard of seal thong is
secured in the eye by a large round knot in one end. No. 89619 [837]
(from Utkiavwĭñ) is of bright green, translucent jade, 5.1 inches long,
and unusually thick, its greatest diameter being 0.6 inch. The tip is
gradually worked off to an oblique edge, and it has ornamental grooves
running through the eye like No. 56662 [393].</p>

<p>No. 89620 [865] (from Nuwŭk) is shaped very much like the type, but
has the tip tapered off almost to a point. It is of olive green,
slightly translucent jade and is 7 inches long. The lanyard is a piece
of sinew

braid with the ends knotted together and the bight looped into the eye.
A&nbsp;large sky-blue glass bead is slipped on over both parts of the
lanyard and pushed up close to the loop. Fig. 163<i>a</i>
(No.&nbsp;89621 [757], from Utkiavwĭñ) is very short and broad (3.6
inches by 0.6), is chamfered at both ends, and has the ornamental
grooves at the eye. The material is a hard, opaque, bluish gray stone,
veined with black.</p>

<p>A whetstone of similar material was brought by Lieut. Stoney from
Kotzebue Sound. The long lanyard is of sinew braid. Fig. 163<i>b</i>
(No.&nbsp;89622 [951], also from Utkiavwĭñ) is a very small, slender
whetstone, 3.3 inches long, of dark olive green semitranslucent jade,
polished. The tip is not chamfered, but tapers to a blunt point. It has
the ornamental grooves at the eye. These are undoubtedly the “stones for
making .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whetstones, or these ready-made” referred to by
Dr. Simpson (Op.&nbsp;cit., p.&nbsp;266) as brought by the Nunatañmiun
from the people of the “Ko-wak River.” A&nbsp;few such whetstones have
been collected on other parts of the northwest coast as far south as the
northern shore of Norton Sound. The broken whetstone mentioned above is
of a beautiful bluish green translucent jade. Bits of stone are also
used for whetstones, such as No. 89786 [1004<i>f</i>], which belong in
Ilû´bw’ga’s tool bag. They are two rough, oblong bits of hard dark gray
slate, apparently split off a flat, weathered surface.</p>

<p>We collected six specimens of a peculiarly shaped long, narrow box,
carved from a single block of wood, which we were informed were formerly
used for holding tools. They have gone out of fashion at the present
day, and there are but few of them left. No. 89860 [1152], Fig.
164<i>a</i>, represents the typical shape of this box. It is carved from
a single block of pine. The cover is slightly hollowed on the under side
and is held on by two double rings of twine (one of seal twine and the
other of sinew braid), large enough to slip over the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page186" id = "page186">
186</a></span>
end. Each ring is made by doubling a long piece of twine so that the two
parts are equal, passing one end through the bight and knotting it to
the other. The box and cover seem to have been painted inside and out
with red ocher. On the outside this is mostly faded and worn off and
covered with dirt, but inside it has turned a dark brown. Fig.
164<i>b</i> (No.&nbsp;89858 [1319], from <ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads ‘Utkiavwĭñ,)’">Utkiavwĭñ),</ins> is a similar box, 21.1
inches long. The cover is held on by a string passing over little hooked
ivory studs close to the edge of the box. There were originally five of
these studs, two at each end and one in the middle of one side. The
string started from one of these studs at the pointed end. This stud is
broken and the string fastened into a hole close to it. To fasten on the
cover the string was carried over and hooked under the opposite stud,
then crossed over the cover to the middle stud, then across to the end
stud on the other side, and the loop on the end hooked onto the last
stud.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 165.&mdash;Large wooden tool

<p>No. 89859 [1318] is a smaller box (19 inches long) of the same
pattern, with only four studs. The cover has three large blue glass
beads, like those used for labrets, inlaid in a line along the middle.
No. 89858 [1144], from Utkiavwĭñ, is the shape of the type, but has a
thicker cover and six stud holes in the margin. No. 89861 [1151], Fig.
165<i>a</i>, from the same place, is shaped something like a violin
case, 22.2 inches long. The cover has been split and “stitched” together
with whalebone, and a crack in the broader end of the box has been
neatly mended by pegging on, with nine little wooden treenails,
a&nbsp;strap of reindeer antler of the same width as the edge and
following the curve of its outline. There are four studs, two at each
end. The string is made fast to one at the smaller end, carried over to
the opposite one, then crossed to the opposite stud at the other end and
back under the last one, a&nbsp;bight of the end being tucked under the
string between the two last-mentioned studs. The string is made of sinew
braid, rope-yarns, and a long piece of seal thong. It was probably at
first all of sinew
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page187" id = "page187">
187</a></span>
braid, and, gradually growing too short by being broken and knotted
together again, was lengthened out with whatever came to hand.</p>

<p>No. 89862 [1593], Fig. 165<i>b</i>, is a large box, of a very
peculiar shape, best understood from the figure. The outside is much
weathered, but appears to have been roughly carved, and the excavation
of the box and cover is very rudely done, perhaps with a stone tool.
A&nbsp;hole in the larger end is mended by a patch of wood chamfered off
to fit the hole and sewed on round the edges with “over-and-over”
stitches of whalebone. The string is arranged in permanent loops, under
which the cover can be slipped off and on.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 166.&mdash;Tool bag of wolverine
skin.</p>

<p>The arrangement, which is rather complicated, is as follows: On one
side of the box, one-half inch from the edge and about 7 inches from
each end, are two pairs of holes, one-half inch apart. Into each pair is
fastened, by means of knots on the inside, a&nbsp;loop of very stout
sinew braid, 3&nbsp;inches long, and similar loops of seal thong,
5&nbsp;inches long, are fastened into corresponding pairs of holes on
the other side. A&nbsp;piece of seal thong is fastened with a
becket-hitch into the loop of seal thong at the small end of the box,
passes through both braid loops on the other side, and is carried over
through the loop of seal thong at the large end. The end of the thong is
knotted into one of the pairs of holes left by the breaking away of a
stitch at the edge of the wooden patch above mentioned.</p>

<p>All these boxes are very old and were painted inside with red ocher,
which has turned dark brown from age. Tools are nowadays kept in a large
oblong, flat satchel, ĭkqûxbwĭñ, which has an arched handle of ivory or
bone stretched lengthwise across the open mouth. These bags are always
made of skin with the hair out, and the skins of wolverines’ heads are
the most desired for this purpose. The collection contains four such
bags. No. 89794 [1018], Fig. 166, is the type of these bags. The bottom
of the bag is a piece of short-haired brown deerskin, with
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page188" id = "page188">
188</a></span>
the hair out, pieced across the middle. The sides and ends are made of
the skins of four wolverine heads, without the lower jaw, cut off at the
nape and spread out and sewed together side by side with the hair
outward and noses up. One head comes on each end of the bag and one on
each side, and the spaces between the noses are filled out with gussets
of deerskin and wolverine skin. A&nbsp;narrow strip of the latter is
sewed round the mouth of the bag. The handle is of walrus ivory, 14½
inches long and about one-half inch square. There is a vertical hole
through it one-half inch from each end, and at one end also a transverse
hole between this and the tip. One end of the thong which fastens the
handle to the bag is drawn through this hole and cut off close to the
surface. The other end is brought over the handle and down through the
vertical hole and made fast with two half-hitches into a hole through
the septum of the nose of the head at one end of the bag. The other end
of the handle is fastened to the opposite nose in the same way, but the
thong is secured in the hole by a simple knot in the end above. On one
side of the handle is an unfinished incised pattern.</p>

<p>Fig. 167, No. 89776 [1004], is a similar bag, made of four wolverine
heads with the lower jaws attached. The bottom is of stout leather
without hair. The mouth is tied up by a bit of thong passed through the
nostrils of the two side heads so that it can spread open only about 1¾
inches. The handle is broad and flat, made of walrus ivory, and
ornamented with an incised border on top. One end is broken and pieced
out with reindeer antler secured by a clumsy “fishing” of seal twine,
which is passed through holes in the two parts. The pieces seem to have
been riveted together as in the drill bow, No. 89777 [1004<i>b</i>]
(Fig. 154), which belongs to this bag. There is a rivet still sticking
in the antler. It is possible that the ivory may have broken in the
process of riveting the two together. The handle has two vertical holes
at each end for the thong, by which it is fastened to the end noses,
both in the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page189" id = "page189">

median line and joined by a short channel on top of the handle. This bag
was the property of the Nunatañmiun Ilûbw’ga, so frequently mentioned,
and was purchased with all its contents.</p>

<p>No. 89796 [1118], from Nuwŭk, is of rather unusual materials. The
bottom is of brown reindeer skin and the sides and ends are the heads of
two wolves and a red fox. The wolf heads meet on one side, and the fox
head is put in between them on the other. The fox head has no lower jaw,
and one wolf head has only the left half of the lower jaw. The vacant
spaces around the mouth are filled by triangular gussets of wolf and
reindeer skin. The eyeholes are patched on the inside with deerskin. It
has no handle. No. 89795 [1309], the remaining bag, is of the usual
pattern, but carelessly made of small pieces of deerskin, with a handle
of coarse-grained whale’s bone. It was probably made for sale.</p>

<p>I have figured four handles of such bags to show the style of
ornamentation. Fig. 170<i>a</i>(No.&nbsp;89420 [1111], from Nuwŭk) has
incised figures of men and reindeer on the back, once colored with
ocher, of which traces can still be seen. This is perhaps a hunting
score. (See remarks on this subject under “Bow drills.”) Fig.
170<i>b</i> (No.&nbsp;89423 [996], from Utkiavwĭñ) is a very elaborate
handle, with scalloped edges and fluted back, which is also ornamented
with an incised pattern colored with red ocher. The other side is
covered with series of the incised circles, each with a dot in the
center, so frequently mentioned. Fig. 170<i>c</i> (No.&nbsp;89424 [890],
from Nuwŭk) has on the under side two rows of figures representing the
flukes and “smalls” of whales. This is the specimen already mentioned,
which the natives called an actual score. The series of twenty-six tails
were said to be the record of old Yûksĭ´ña (“Erksinra” of Dr. Simpson),
the so-called “chief” at Nuwŭk. All the above handles are of walrus
ivory, and have been in actual use. Fig. 170<i>c</i> (No.&nbsp;56513
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page190" id = "page190">
190</a></span>
[43], from Utkiavwĭñ) is a handle of different material (reindeer
antler) and of somewhat different pattern. One end is neatly carved into
an exceedingly accurate image of the head of a reindeer which has shed
its antlers, with small blue beads inlaid for the eyes. The back of the
handle is ornamented with an incised pattern colored with red ocher. We
were told that such handles were sometimes fitted to the wooden buckets,
but I never saw one so used.</p>

<p>No. 89798 [1075], Fig. 171, is a bag of rather unusual pattern, the
only one of the kind we saw. The bottom is a single round piece,
9&nbsp;inches in diameter, of what seems to be split skin of the bearded
seal, flesh side out, and the rest of the bag is of white-tanned seal
leather. The sides are of five broad pieces (6,&nbsp;4½, 4, 5½, and 5
inches broad at the bottom, respectively, narrowing to 2½, 1½, 1¼, 2,
and 2⅓, respectively, at the top), alternating with five straight
strips, respectively 1½, 1, 1⅓, 1¼, and 1½ inches broad. The edges of
these strips overlap the edges of the broad pieces, and are neatly
stitched with two threads, as on the soles of the waterproof boots. The
outer thread, which is caught in the loop of each stitch of the other,
is a slender filament of black <ins class = "correction" title =
"hyphenin original">whale-bone</ins>. This produces a sort of embroidery. The
neck is stitched to the bag with the same seam, but the hem at the mouth
is merely “run” round with sinew. This bag was probably for holding
small tools and similar articles.</p>

<p>As would naturally be expected from what has been said of the
peaceful character of these people, offensive weapons, specially
intended for use against men, are exceedingly rare. In case of quarrels
between individuals or parties the bows, spears, and knives intended for
hunting or general use would be turned against their enemies. Even their
rifles, nowadays, are kept much more for hunting than as weapons of
offense, and the revolvers of various patterns which many of them have
obtained from the ships are chiefly carried when traveling back and
forth between the two villages as a protection against a possible bear.
We, however, obtained a few weapons which were especially designed for
taking human life. One of these was a little club (tĭ´glun)
(No.&nbsp;89492 [1310], Fig. 172, from Utkiavwĭñ) made of the butt end
of an old pickax head of whale’s bone, with the point cut down to a
blunt end. It is 6.4 inches long and meant to be clenched in the hand
like a dagger, and used for striking blows, probably at the temple. The
transverse grooves for hafting give a good hold for the fingers. This
was the only weapon of the kind seen.</p>

<p>We collected a single specimen of a kind of slung shot, No. 89472
[905] (Fig. 173), made of a roughly ovoid lump of heavy bone, the
symphysis of the lower jaw of a walrus, 3⅓ inches long. At the smaller
end two large holes are bored in obliquely so as to meet under the
surface and form a channel through which is passed a slip of white seal
skin about 15 inches long, the ends of which fasten together with two
slits, so as to make a loop. This may be compared with the stone balls
used by the ancient Aleuts for striking a man on the temple.</p>

<p>The commonest weapon of offense was a broad dagger made of a bone of
the polar bear. This was said to be especially meant for killing a “bad
man,” possibly for certain specified offenses or perhaps in cases of
insanity. Insane persons were sometimes killed in Greenland, and the act
was considered “neither decidedly admissible
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page192" id = "page192">
192</a></span>
nor altogether unlawful.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag288" id = "tag288"
href = "#note288">288</a> The use of bears’ bones for these weapons
points to some superstitious idea, perhaps having reference to the
ferocity of the animal. We collected five specimens of these daggers, of
which No. 89484 [767], Fig. 174, has been selected as the type. It is
the distal end of the ulna of a polar bear, with the neck and condyles
forming the hilt, and the shaft split so as to expose the medullary
cavity and cut into a pointed blade. It is very old, blackened, and
crumbling on the surface, and is a foot long.</p>

<p>Fig. 175<i>a</i>, No. 89475 [988], from Nuwŭk, is made of a straight
splinter from the shaft of one of the long bones, 9¾ inches long. No.
89480 [1141], from Utkiavwĭñ, has a roughly whittled hilt and a somewhat
twisted blade, rather narrow, but widened to a sharp lanceolate point.
It is 12 inches long. No. 89481 [1175], from the same place, has the
roughly shaped hilt whipped with two turns of sinew. No. 89482 [1709],
Fig. 175<i>b</i>, also from Utkiavwĭñ, is dirk-shaped, having but one
edge and a straight back. The hilt, as before, is roughly sawed from the
solid head of the bone. No. 89485 [965], Fig. 176, from Nuwŭk, was also
said to be a dagger, but could not have been a very effective weapon. It
is of whale’s bone, 5&nbsp;inches long. It is rather rudely carved, old,
and dirty, but the notches on the haft are newly cut.</p>

<p>Dirks or daggers of bear’s bone, like those described, are really
rather formidable weapons, as it is easy to give the splinter of bone a
very keen point. The Museum contains a bone dagger curiously like these
Eskimo weapons, but made of the bone of the grizzly bear, and used by
the Indians of the McCloud River, northern California. They believe that
the peculiar shape of the point, having a hollow (the medullary cavity)
on one face, like the Eskimo daggers, causes the wound to bleed
internally.</p>

<p>When Dease and Simpson first met these people, in 1837, they had no
firearms, but the next party of whites who came in contact with them
(Pullen and Hooper, in 1849) found the “chief” in possession of an old
shaky musket of English make, with the name “Barnett” on the lock.<a

the natives told him, they had procured “from the other tribes to the

ammunition from the eastern natives. Yûksĭña and two other men each
bought a gun this year.<a class = "tag" name = "tag293" id = "tag293"

<p>As the whalers began to go to Point Barrow in 1854, the opportunity
for obtaining firearms has been afforded the natives every year since
then, so that they are now well supplied with guns, chiefly of American
manufacture. That all their firearms have not been obtained from this
source is probable from the fact they have still in their possession a
number of smoothbore percussion guns, double and single barreled, of
Russian manufacture. They are all stamped in Russian with the name of
Tula, a&nbsp;town on the Oopa, 105 miles south of Moscow, which has
received the name of the “Sheffield and Birmingham of Russia,” from its
vast manufactory of arms, established by Peter the Great. These guns
must have come from the “Nunatañmiun,” who obtained them either from the
Siberian traders or from the Russians at Norton Sound through the
Malemiut. Both smoothbore and rifled guns are in general use. The
smoothbores are of all sorts and descriptions, from an old flintlock
musket to more or less valuable single and double percussion
fowling-pieces. Three of the natives now (1883) have cheap double
breechloaders and one a single breechloader (made by John
P.&nbsp;Lovell, of Boston). Guns in general are called “cupûñ,” an
onomatopœic word in general use in western America, but many of the
different kinds have special names. For instance, a&nbsp;double gun is
called madro´lĭñ (from <i>madro</i>, <i>two</i>). The rifles are also of
many different patterns. The kind preferred by the natives is the
ordinary Winchester brass-mounted 15-shot repeater, which the whalers
and traders purchase cheaply at wholesale. This is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page194" id = "page194">
194</a></span>
called akĭmiɐlĭñ (“that which has fifteen,” sc., shots). The whalers are
also in the habit of buying up all sorts of cheap or second-hand guns
for the Arctic trade, so that many other kinds of guns are also common.
Of breechloaders, we saw the Sharpe’s rifle, savĭgro´lĭñ (from a fancied
resemblance between the crooked lever of this gun and the crooked knife,
savigro´n); other patterns of Winchester; the Spencer repeater,
kai´psualĭñ (from kaipsĭ, cartridge); the peculiar Sharps-Hankins, once
used in the U.S.&nbsp;Navy, and which was the favorite weapon of the
rebel Boers in South Africa; the Peabody-Martini, made in America for
the Turkish Government, marked on the rear sight with Turkish figures,
and, exposed with a corpse at the cemetery, one English Snider. The
regulation Springfield rifles belonging to the post, which were often
loaned to the natives for the purpose of hunting, were called
mûkpara´lĭñ (from <i>mûkpara´</i>, book, referring to the breech action,
which opens like a book).</p>

<p>They formerly had very few muzzle-loading rifles, but of late years,
since the law against trading arms to the natives has been construed to
refer solely to breech-loading rifles, the whalers have sold them <ins
class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">yäger</ins> rifles, of
the old U.S.&nbsp;Army pattern, Enfield rifles, ship’s muskets with the
Tower mark on them, and a sort of bogus rifle made especially for trade,
in imitation of the old-fashioned Kentucky rifle, but with grooves
extending only a short distance from the muzzle. They of course depend
on the ships for their supplies of ammunition, though the Nunatañmiun
sometimes bring a few cartridges smuggled across from Siberia. They
naturally are most desirous to procure cartridges for the rim-fire
Winchester guns, as these are not intended to be used more than once.
They have, however, invented a method of priming these rim-fire shells
so that they can be reloaded. A&nbsp;common “G.&nbsp;D.” percussion cap
is neatly fitted into the rim of the shell by cutting the sides into
strips which are folded into slits in the shell, a&nbsp;little hole
being drilled under the center of the cap to allow the flash to reach
the powder. This is a very laborious process, but enables the natives to
use a rifle which would otherwise be useless. Such cartridges reloaded
with powder and home-made bullets&mdash;they have many bullet molds and
know how to use them&mdash;are tolerably effective. Great care must be
taken to insert the cartridge right side up, so that the cap shall be
struck by the firing pin, which interferes with using the gun as a
repeater.</p>

<p>They are very careless with their rifles, allowing them to get rusty,
and otherwise misusing them, especially by firing small shot from them
in the duck-shooting season. As a rule they are very fair shots with the
rifle, but extremely lavish of ammunition when they have a supply. The
only economy is shown in reloading cartridges and in loading their
shotguns, into which they seldom put a sufficient charge. In spite of
this some of them shoot very well with the shotgun, though many of them
show great stupidity in judging distance, firing light
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page195" id = "page195">
195</a></span>
charges of shot at short rifle range (100 to 200 yards). Though they
mold their own bullets, I&nbsp;have never known any of them to attempt
making shot or slugs. This, which they call kăkrúra (little bullets,
from kă´kru, originally meaning <i>arrow</i> and now used for
<i>bullet</i> as well) is always obtained from the whites. The gun is
habitually carried in a case or holster long enough to cover the whole
gun, made of sealskin, either black-tanned or with the hair on the
outside. This, like the bow case, from which it is evidently copied, is
slung across the back by a thong passing round the shoulders and across
the chest. This is the method universally practiced for carrying burdens
of all sorts. The butt of the gun is on the right side, so that it can
be easily slipped out of the holster under the right arm without
unslinging it. Revolvers are also carried slung in holsters on the back
in the same way. Ammunition is carried in a pouch slung over the
shoulder. They are careless in handling firearms and ammunition. We knew
two men who shot off the tip of the forefinger while filing cartridges
which had failed to explode in the gun.</p>

<p>In addition to the kinds of firearms for land hunting above described
a number of the natives have procured from the whalemen, either by
purchase or from wrecks, whaling guns, such as are used by the American
whalers, in place of the steel lance for dispatching the whale after it
is harpooned. These are of various patterns, both muzzle and breech
loading, and they are able to procure nearly every year a small supply
of the explosive lances to be shot from them. They use them as the white
men do for killing harpooned whales, and also, when the leads of open
water are narrow, for shooting them as they pass close to the edge of
the ice.</p>

<p>In former times the bow was the only projectile weapon which these
people possessed that could be used at a longer range than the “dart” of
a harpoon. It was accordingly used for hunting the bear, the wolf, and
the reindeer, for shooting birds, and in case of necessity, for warfare.
It is worthy of note, in this connection, as showing that the use of the
bow for fighting was only a secondary consideration, that none of their
arrows are regular “war arrows” like those made by the Sioux or other
Indians; that is, arrows to be shot with the breadth of the head
horizontal, so as to pass between the horizontal ribs of a man. Firearms
have now almost completely superseded the bow for actual work, though a
few men, too poor to obtain guns, still use them.</p>

<p>Every boy has a bow for a plaything, with which he shoots small birds
and practices at marks. Very few boys, however, show any great skill
with it. We never had an opportunity of seeing an adult shoot with the
bow and arrow; but they have not yet lost the art of bow-making. The
newest boys’ bows are as skillfully and ingeniously constructed as the
old bows, but are of course smaller and weaker. The bow in use among
these people was the universal sinew-backed bow of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page196" id = "page196">
196</a></span>
the Eskimo carried to its highest degree of efficiency.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag294" id = "tag294" href = "#note294">294</a> It was of what I
have called the “Arctic type,” namely, a&nbsp;rather short bow of
spruce, from 43 to 52 inches in length, nearly elliptical in section,
but flatter on the back than on the belly, and slightly narrowed and
thickened at the handle. The greatest breadth was usually about 1¼
inches and the thickness at the handle about three-fourths of an inch.
The ends were often bent up as in the Tatar bow, and were sometimes
separate pieces mortised on. Strength and elasticity was given to the
brittle spruce by applying a number of strands of sinew to the back of
the bow in such a way that drawing the bowstring stretched all these
elastic cords, thus adding their elasticity to that of the wood. This
backing was always a continuous piece of a three-ply braid of sinew,
about the size of stout pack thread, and on a large bow often 40 or 50
yards long. It began, as on all Eskimo bows which I have been able to
examine (except those from St. Lawrence Island and the mainland of
Siberia&mdash;my “western type”), with an eye at one end of the cord
looped over one nock of the bow, usually the upper. The cord was then
laid on the back of the bow in long strands running up and down and
round the nocks, as usual on the other types of bow, but after putting
on a number of these, began running backward and forward between the
bends (if&nbsp;the bow was of the Tatar shape), or between corresponding
points on a straight bow, where they were fastened with complicated
hitches around the bow in such a way that the shortest strands came to
the top of the backing, which was thus made to grow thicker gradually
toward the middle of the bow, where the greatest strength and elasticity
were needed. When enough strands had been laid on they were divided into
two equal parcels and twisted from the middle into two tight cables,
thus greatly increasing the tension to be overcome in drawing the bow.
These cables being secured to the handle of the bow, the end of the cord
was used to seize the whole securely to the bow.</p>

<p>This seizing and the hitches already mentioned served to incorporate
the backing very thoroughly with the bow, thus equalizing the strain and
preventing the bow from cracking. This made a very stiff and powerful
bow, capable of sending an arrow with great force. We were told by a
reliable native that a stone-headed arrow was often driven by
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page197" id = "page197">
197</a></span>
one of these bows wholly through a polar bear, “if there was no bone.”
Three bows only were obtained: One from Nuwŭk, one from Utkiavwĭñ
(a&nbsp;lad’s bow), and one from Sidaru.</p>

<p>The bow from Utkiavwĭñ, No. 89904 [786] (Fig. 177), though small, is
in some respects nearer the type than the other two, and has been
selected for description. The body of the bow is a single piece of the
heart of a log of spruce driftwood 36¼ inches long, elliptical in
section, flattened more on the back than on the belly. It is tapered to
the nocks, which are small club-shaped knobs, and narrowed and thickened
at the handle. The backing is of round three-ply braid of sinew in one
continuous piece. The string is a round four-ply braid with a loop at
each end, made by tying a single knot in the standing part, passing the
end through this and taking a half hitch with it round the standing part
(Fig. 178). The upper loop is a little the larger.</p>

<p>No. 89245 [25] (Fig. 179), from Nuwŭk, is a full-sized man’s bow,
which is old and has been long in use. It is of the same material, and
is 47.3 inches long. Its greatest breadth is 1⅓ inches, and it is 0.8
inch thick at the handle. It is slightly narrowed and thinned off from
the broadest part to about 6 inches from each tip, and is then gradually
thickened to the nocks and bent up so that the ends make an angle of
about 45° with the bow when unstrung. The ends are separate pieces
fitted on at the bends. The ends of the body are chamfered off laterally
to a wedge which fits into a corresponding notch in the end piece,
making a scarf 3¼ inches long, which is strengthened by a curved strap
of antler, convex above and thickest in the middle, fitting into the
bend on the back. The joint is held together wholly by the backing.</p>

<p>We never saw bows of this pattern made and consequently did not learn
how the bending was accomplished. The method is probably the same as
that seen by Capt. Beechey in 1826, at Kotzebue Sound (Voyage,
p.&nbsp;575). The bow was wrapped in wet shavings and held over the
fire, and then pegged down on the ground (probably on one side), into
shape. A&nbsp;strip of rawhide (the split skin of the bearded seal, with
the grain side out), 1&nbsp;inch wide, runs along the back from bend to
bend under the backing. The chief peculiarity of this bow is the third
cable, above the other two, and the great and apparently unnecessary
complication of the hitches.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page198" id = "page198">
198</a></span>
<p>No. 72771 [234], from Sidaru (Fig. 180<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), is a
bow with bent ends like the last, but all in one piece and smaller. Its
length is 43½ inches and its greatest breadth 1⅓. The backing has only
two cables, and its chief peculiarity is in having the loose end of the
last strand twisted into one of the cables, while the seizing, of the
same pattern as in the last bow, is made of a separate piece. The
workmanship of this bow is particularly neat, and it is further
strengthened with strips of rawhide (the skin of the bearded seal,
split), under the backing. The method of making the string is very
ingenious. It appears to have been made on the bow, as follows: Having
the bow sprung back one end of a long piece of sinew twine was made fast
temporarily to the upper nock, leaving an end long enough to finish off
the bowstring. The other end was carried round the lower nock and the
returning strand half-hitched round the first snugly up to the nock, and
then carried round the upper nock and back again. This was repeated,
each strand being half-hitched round all the preceding at the lower nock
until there were eight parallel strands, and an eye fitted snugly to the
lower nock. The bight was then slipped off the upper nock, the end
untied and the whole twisted tight. This twisted string is now about 2
inches too long, so the upper eye is made by doubling over 2 inches of
the end and stopping it down with the free end mentioned above, thus
making a long eye of seven strands. With the end, six similar strands
are added to the eye, each being stopped to the twist with a half hitch.
The end is neatly tucked in and the strands of the eye twisted tightly
together.</p>

<p>In my paper on Eskimo bows, already mentioned, I came to the
conclusion that the bows formerly used by the Eskimo of western North
America and the opposite coast of Asia were constructed upon three well
defined types of definite geographical distribution, and each easily
recognized as a development of a simple original type still to be found
in Baffin Land in a slightly modified form. These three types are:</p>

<p>I. The Southern type, which was the only form used from the island of
Kadiak to Cape Romanzoff, and continued in frequent use as far as Norton
Sound, though separated by no hard and fast line from</p>

<p>II. The Arctic type, to which the bows just described belong, in use
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page199" id = "page199">
199</a></span>
from the Kaviak peninsula to the Mackenzie and Anderson rivers; and</p>

<p>III. The Western type, confined to St. Lawrence Island and the
mainland of Siberia.</p>

<p>I have shown how these three types differ from each other and from
the original type, and have expressed the opinion that these differences
result from the different resources at the command of the people of
different regions. I&nbsp;have also endeavored to account for the fact
that we find sporadic examples of the Arctic type, for instance as far
south as the Yukon, by the well known habits of the Eskimo in regard to
trading expeditions.</p>

<p>Outside of the region treated in my paper above referred to, there is
very little material for a comparative study of Eskimo bows, either in
the Museum or in the writings of travelers. Most writers have contented
themselves with a casual reference to some of the more salient
peculiarities of the weapon without giving any detailed information.
Beginning at the extreme north of Greenland, we find that the so-called
“Arctic Highlanders” have hardly any knowledge of the bow. Dr. Kane saw
none during his intercourse with them, but Dr. Bessels<a class = "tag"
name = "tag295" id = "tag295" href = "#note295">295</a> mentions seeing
one bow, made of pieces of antler spliced together, in the possession of
a man at Ita. In Danish Greenland, the use of the bow has been abandoned
for many years. When Crantz<a class = "tag" name = "tag296" id =
"tag296" href = "#note296">296</a> wrote it had already gone out of use,
though in Egede’s<a class = "tag" name = "tag297" id = "tag297" href =
"#note297">297</a> time it was still employed. It appears to have been
longer than the other Eskimo bows. Nordenskiöld<a class = "tag" name =
"tag298" id = "tag298" href = "#note298">298</a> reproduces a picture of
a group of Greenlanders from an old painting of the date of 1654 in the
Ethnographical Museum of Copenhagen. The man holds in his left hand a
straight bow, which appears to have the backing reaching only part way
to the ends like a western bow without the end cables, and yet twisted
into two cables. If this representation be a correct one, this
arrangement of the backing, taken in connection with what Crantz and
Egede say of the great length of the bow, would be an argument in favor
of my theory that the St. Lawrence Island bow was developed from the
primitive form by lengthening the ends of the bow without lengthening
the backing. The addition of the end cables would then be an after
invention, peculiar to the western bow. In Baffin Land the bow is very
rudely made, and approaches very closely to my supposed primitive form.
Owing to the scarcity of wood in this region the bow was frequently made
of reindeer antler, a&nbsp;substance still more unsuitable for the
purpose than the soft coniferous woods used elsewhere. There are in the
Museum three specimens of such antler bows, brought from Cumberland Gulf
by Mr. Kumlien.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page200" id = "page200">
200</a></span>
<p>The first mention of the Eskimo bow with sinew backing will be found
in Frobisher’s account of his visit to Meta Incognita in 1577:<a class =
"tag" name = "tag299" id = "tag299" href = "#note299">299</a> “Their
bowes are of wood of a yard long, sinewed on the back with strong
sinewes, not glued too, but fast girded and tyed on. Their bowe strings
are likewise sinewes.”</p>

<p>Of the bow used at the straits of Fury and Hecla we have a most
excellent figure in Parry’s Second Voyage (Pl.&nbsp;opposite
p.&nbsp;550, Fig.&nbsp;22), and the most accurate description to be
found in any author. It is, in fact, as exact a description as could be
made from an external examination of the bow. From the figure the bow
appears to have been almost of the arctic type, having an unusual number
of strands (sometimes sixty, p.&nbsp;511) which are not, however,
twisted, but secured with a spiral wrapping, as on southern bows. The
backing is stopped to the handle, but not otherwise seized. It appears
to have been rather a large bow, as Parry gives the length of one of
their best bows, made of a single piece of fir, as “4&nbsp;feet 8
inches” (p.&nbsp;510). “A&nbsp;bow of one piece is, however, very rare;
they generally consist of from two to five pieces of bone of unequal
lengths, fastened together by rivets and treenails” (p.&nbsp;511). Parry
also speaks of the use of wedges for tightening the backing. Schwatka<a
class = "tag" name = "tag300" id = "tag300" href = "#note300">300</a>
speaks of the Netyĭlĭk of King Williams Land as using bows of spliced
pieces of musk-ox horn or driftwood, but gives no further description of
them. Ellis<a class = "tag" name = "tag301" id = "tag301" href =
"#note301">301</a> describes the bow in use at Hudson’s Strait in 1746
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
Their greatest Ingenuity is shown in the Structure of their Bows, made
commonly of three Pieces of Wood, each making a part of the same Arch,
very nicely and exactly joined together. They are commonly of Fir or
Larch, which the English there call Juniper, and as this wants Strength
and Elasticity, they supply both by bracing the Back of the Bow with a
kind of Thread or Line made of the Sinew of their Deer, and the
Bowstring of the same material. To make them draw more stiffly, they dip
them into Water, which causes both the Back of the Bow and the String to
contract, and consequently gives it the greater force.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag302" id = "tag302" href = "#note302">302</a></blockquote>

<p>Ellis’s figure (plate opposite p. 132) shows a bow of the Tatar
shape, but gives no details of the backing, except that the latter
appears to be twisted.</p>

<p>We have no published descriptions of the bows used in other
regions.</p>

<p>As far as I have been able to ascertain, the practice of backing the
bow with cords of sinew is peculiar to the Eskimo, though some American
Indians stiffen the bow by gluing flat pieces of sinew upon the
back.</p>

<p>One tribe of Indians, the “Loucheux” of the Mackenzie district,
however, used bows like those of the Eskimos, but Sir Alexander
Mackenzie<a class = "tag" name = "tag303" id = "tag303" href =

Eskimo.</p>

<p>With these bows were used arrows of various patterns adapted for
different kinds of game. There are in the collection fifty-one arrows,
which are all about the same length, 25 to 30 inches. In describing
these arrows I shall employ the terms used in modern archery<a class =
"tag" name = "tag304" id = "tag304" href = "#note304">304</a> for the
parts of the arrow. The greatest variation is in the shape and size of
the pile. The stele is almost always a straight cylindrical rod, almost
invariably 0.4 inch in diameter, and ranging in length from 20 to 28
inches. Twenty-five inches is the commonest length, and the short
steles, when not intended for a boy’s bow, are generally fitted with an
unusually long pile. From the beginning of the feathering the stele is
gradually flattened above and below to the nock, which is a simple notch
almost always 0.2 inch wide and of the same depth. The stele is
sometimes slightly widened just in front of the nock to give a better
hold for the fingers. The feathering is 6 or 7 inches long, consisting
of two, or less often, three feathers. (The set of sixteen arrows from
Sidaru, two from Nuwŭk, and one from Utkiavwĭñ, have three feathers. The
rest of the fifty-one have two.) The shaft of the feather is split and
the web is cut narrow, and tapered off to a point at each end (Fig.
181). The ends of the feathers are fastened to the stele with whippings
of fine sinew, the small end of the feather which, of course, comes at
the nock, being often wedged into a slit in the wood (with a special
tool to be described below), or else doubled back over a few turns of
the whipping and lashed down with the rest. The small end of the feather
is almost always twisted about one turn, evidently to make the arrow
revolve in flight, like a rifle ball. Generally, if not universally, the
feathering was made of the feathers of some bird of prey, falcon, eagle,
or raven, probably with some notion of giving to the arrow the
death-dealing quality of the bird. Out of the fifty-one arrows in the
collection, only nine are feathered with gull’s feathers, and of these
all but two are new, or newly feathered for sale to us.<a class = "tag"

<p>These are of three kinds, all having a broad, sharp pile, often

material”). Of this kind we have eight complete arrows and one

a whipping of about fifteen turns of fine sinew. The stele is of spruce,
25½ inches long and four-tenths inch in diameter, and painted with red
ocher from the feathering to 5 inches from the pile. The three feathers,
apparently those of the gyrfalcon, have their ends simply whipped to the
stele. They are 6 inches long. This is one of the two arrows from Nuwŭk
with three feathers.</p>

<p>No. 72780 [234<i>a</i>], from Sidaru, is feathered with three raven
feathers, of which the small ends are wedged into slits in the wood. The
pile is of brown jasper, long and lancet-tipped, expanding into rounded
wings at each side of the base. The stele is peculiar only in being
slightly widened in front of the nock. It is of pine, 26.8 inches long,

<p>The only variations of importance in these arrows are in the shape of
the pile, which is made of black or gray flint, or less often of jasper,
mostly variegated, brown and gray. There are four patterns to be found
in the series of eight arrows and twenty-two stone piles. The first is
long and narrow, like No. 56704 [232], Fig. 183, from Utkiavwĭñ, which
is of gray flint. The next is similar in shape, but shorter, as shown in
Fig. 182 (No.&nbsp;89240 [25], from Nuwŭk), which is only 2 inches long,
exclusive of the tang. The third pattern, which is less common than the
others, is about the size of the last, but rhomboidal in shape (Fig.
184, No. 56691<i>c</i> [64<i>c</i>], from Utkiavwĭñ, of dark grayish
brown flint, rather coarsely flaked). The fourth kind is very short,
being not over 1½ inches, including the half-inch tang, but is 1 inch
broad, thick and convex on both faces. It is triangular, with a square
base and curved edges (Fig. 185, No. 56702<i>b</i> [113<i>b</i>], from
Utkiavwĭñ, newly made for sale).</p>

<p>No stone arrow or dart heads made by these people have anything like
barbs except the square shoulders at the base. They seem never to have
attained to the skill in flint-working which enabled many other savages
to make the beautiful barbed heads so often seen. To keep the
flint-headed arrow from dropping out of the wound they hit upon the
contrivance of mounting it not directly in the stele but in a piece of
bone upon which barbs could be cut, or, as is not unlikely, having
already the deer arrow with the barbed head of antler, they added the
flint head to this, thus combining the penetration of the flint arrow
with the holding power of the other. I&nbsp;was at first inclined to
think that this piece of bone bore the same relation to the rest of the
arrow as the fore shaft of many Indian arrows, and was to be considered
as part of the stele. Considering, however, that its sole function is to
furnish the pile with barbs, it evidently must be considered as part of
the latter. I&nbsp;shall designate it as “after-pile.” Arrows with this
barbed “after-pile” form the second kind of bear arrows, which are
called ipudlĭ´gadlĭñ (“having the ipu´dlĭgɐ” [Gr. ipuligak, the similar
bone head of a seal lance with iron tip]). After the introduction of
iron, metal piles sometimes replaced the flint in arrows of this kind.
We collected eight with flint and two with metal piles. No. 72787
[234<i>a</i>], Fig. 186<i>a</i>, has been selected to illustrate this
form of arrow. This pile is of gray flint with the tang wedged by a slip
of sealskin into the tip of the after-pile, which is cleft to receive it
and kept from splitting by a whipping of sinew. The after-pile is fitted
into the tip of the stele with a rounded sharp-pointed tang, slightly
enlarged just above the tip. It is of reindeer
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page204" id = "page204">
204</a></span>
antler. The rest of the arrow does not differ from those previously
described. The stele is of pine and is feathered with three gyrfalcon
feathers.</p>

<p>Two others from Sidaru have only a single barb on the after-pile, but
the other four have two, one behind the other on the same side. No.
89237 [164], from Utkiavwĭñ, differs in no respect from the
single-barbed flint arrows from Sidaru, but No. 72763 [164], from the
same village, has four small barbs on the after-pile, which is unusually
(nearly 7 inches) long, and a pile of sheet brass. This has the basal
angles on each side cut into three small, sharp, backward-pointing
teeth. The total length of this arrow is 28 inches.</p>

<p>The after-piles of all arrows except one were of reindeer antler,
which is another reason for supposing that this form of arrow is a
modification of the deer arrow. After the introduction of iron, this
metal or copper was substituted for the flint pile of the kukĭ´ksadlĭñ,
making the third and last form of bear arrow, the sa´vĭdlĭñ (“fitted
with iron”). This arrow differs from the others only in the form of the
pile, which is generally broad and flat, and either rhomboidal, with the
base cut into numerous small teeth, or else triangular, with a shank.
The barbs are usually bilateral.</p>

<p>No. 72758 [25], from Nuwŭk, represents the first form. The pile is of
iron, rough and flat, 2½ inches long. No. 72770 [241<i>b</i>], from
Utkiavwĭñ, is of the same form. No. 72760 [165], Fig. 186<i>c</i>, from
Utkiavwĭñ, has a similar pile 3.3 inches long, but has each of the under
edges cut into four sharp, backward-pointing teeth. No. 72778
[234<i>b</i>], Fig. 186<i>d</i>, has a pile of sheet copper 2.3 inches
long, of the same shape, but with six teeth. This arrow came from
Sidaru. No. 72765 [25], from Nuwŭk, is a long, narrow iron pile with
three bilateral barbs, all simple.</p>

<p>Nos. 72755 [25], from Nuwŭk, 72759 [25], also from Nuwŭk, and 72764
[165], from Utkiavwĭñ, show the shanked form. The first is triangular,
with a flat shank and a simple barb at each angle of the base. It is of
steel (piece of a saw) and 2.8 inches long. The second resembles No.
72760 [165], with more teeth, mounted on a slender cylindrical shank 1½
inches long. It is of iron and 3.9 inches long. The third is a long pile
with a sinuate outline and one pair of simple bilateral barbs, and a
flat shank one-half inch long. Nos. 72757 [25] (Fig. 186b) and 72762
[25], both from Nuwŭk, are peculiar in being the only iron-pointed
arrows with unilateral barbs. The piles are made of the two blades of a
pair of large scissors, cut off at the point, with enough of the handle
left to make a tang. The unilateral barb is filed out on the back of the
blade, which has been beveled down on both faces to a sharp edge. All of
these broadheaded arrows have the breadth of the pile at right angles to
the plane of the nock, showing that they are not meant to fly like the
Sioux war arrows. Although iron makes a better material for arrow piles
and is more easily worked than flint, the quivers which some men still
carry at Point Barrow contain flint as well as iron headed arrows. They
are probably
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page205" id = "page205">
205</a></span>
kept in use from the superstitious conservatism already mentioned. It is
certain that the man who raised a couple of wolf cubs for the sake of
their fur was obliged by tradition to have a flint-headed arrow to kill
them with. These arrows, we were informed, were especially designed for
hunting “nä´nu,” the polar bear, but of course they also served for use
against other dangerous game, like the wolf and brown bear, and there is
no reason to believe that they were not also shot at reindeer, though
the hunter would naturally use his deer arrows first.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 187.&mdash;Pile of deer arrow
(nûtkăñ).</p>

<p>Deer arrows have a long trihedral pile of antler from 4 to 8 inches
long, with a sharp thin-edged point slightly concaved on the faces like
the point of a bayonet. Two of the edges are rounded, but the third is
sharp and cut into one or more simple barbs. Behind the barb the pile
takes the form of a rounded shank, ending in a shoulder and a sharp
rounded tang a little enlarged above the point.</p>

<p>No. 72768 [162], Fig. 186<i>e</i> from Utkiavwĭñ, has a pile 3½
inches long with two barbs. The pile of No. 89238 [162] from the same
village is 3½ inches long and has but one barb, while that of No.
89241<i>a</i> [162] is 7.8 inches long and has three barbs. The rudely
incised figure on the shank of No. 89238 [162] represents a wolf,
probably a talisman to make the arrow as fatal to the deer as the wolf
is. No. 56588 [13], Fig. 187, is a pile for one of these arrows slightly
peculiar in shape, being elliptical in section, with one edge sharp and
two-barbed and a four-sided point. The figure shows well the shape of
the tang. The peculiarity of these arrows is that the pile is not
fastened to the shaft, but can easily be detached.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag307" id = "tag307" href = "#note307">307</a> When such an arrow
was shot into a deer the shaft would easily be shaken out, leaving the

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 188.&mdash;Kûñmûdlĭñ arrow
pile.</p>
</div>

<p>The Eskimo told us that a deer wounded in this way would “sleep once
and die,” meaning, apparently, that death would ensue in about
twenty-four hours, probably from peritonitis. The bone pile is called
nû´tkăñ, whence comes the name of the arrow, nû´tko´dlĭñ. We collected
ten arrows and three piles of this pattern. No. 89460 [1263], Fig. 188,
is a peculiar bone arrow pile, perhaps intended for a deer arrow. It is
7 inches long and made of one of the long bones of some large bird,
split lengthwise so that it is rounded on one side and deeply concave on
the other, with two thin rounded edges tapered to a sharp point. Each
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page206" id = "page206">
206</a></span>
edge has three little barbs about the middle of the pile. This was the
only arrowhead of the kind seen at Point Barrow, and the native who sold
it said it was a “Kûñmûd´lĭñ” arrow. I&nbsp;was pleased to find the
truth of this corroborated by the Museum collection. There are two
arrows from the Mackenzie region (Nos. 1106 and 1906) with bone piles of
almost the same form.</p>

<p>For shooting gulls, geese, and other large fowl they used an arrow
with a straight polygonal pile of walrus ivory, 5&nbsp;or 6 inches long
and about one-half inch in diameter, terminating in a somewhat obtuse
polygonal point, and having one or more unilateral barbs. These piles
are generally five-sided, though sometimes trihedral, and have a long,
rounded tang inserted into the end of the shaft. Fig. 189<i>a</i>
(No.&nbsp;89349 [119] from Utkiavwĭñ), represents one of these arrows
with a five-sided pile 5.5 inches long, with four simple barbs. The rest
of the arrow does not differ from the others described. No. 89238 [25],
from Nuwŭk, has a trihedral pile 6.6 inches long, with a single barb.
Another from Nuwŭk (No.&nbsp;89241 [25]) has a trihedral pile 5.3 inches
long, with two barbs, and one from Utkiavwĭñ (No.&nbsp;89241 [119]) has
a five-sided pile with three barbs. The remaining three, from Sidaru,
all have five-sided piles with one barb.</p>

<p>Arrows of this pattern are called tuga´lĭñ (from tu´ga, walrus
ivory). There are also in the collection two small arrows of this
pattern suited for a boy’s bow. They are only 25 inches long, and have
roughly trihedral sharp-pointed ivory piles about 4 inches long, without
barbs. (No.&nbsp;89904<i>a</i> [786] from Utkiavwĭñ). These arrows are
new and rather carelessly made, and were intended for the lad’s bow
(No.&nbsp;89904 [786]) already described. The three kinds of arrows
which have been described all have the pile secured to the stele by a
tang fitting into a cleft or hole in the end of the latter, which is
kept from splitting by whipping it with sinew for about one-half
inch.</p>

<p>The fourth kind, the blunt bird arrow (kĭ´xodwain), on the other
hand, has the pile cleft to receive the wedge-shaped tip of the stele
and secured by a whipping of sinew. The four arrows of this kind in the
collection are almost exactly alike, except that three of them,
belonging to the set from Sidaru, have three feathers. Fig. 189<i>b</i>,
No. 72773 [234<i>c</i>] from Sidaru represents the form of arrow. The
pile is of hard bone 2.3 inches long. A&nbsp;little rim at each side of
the butt keeps the whipping of sinew from slipping off. The rest of the
arrow differs from the others described only in having the end of the
stele chamfered down to a wedge-shaped point to fit into the pile.</p>

<p>This is the kind of arrow mostly used by the boys, whose game is
almost exclusively small birds or lemmings. Nowadays the bone pile
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page207" id = "page207">
207</a></span>
is often replaced by an empty cartridge shell, which makes a very good
head. I&nbsp;have seen a phalarope transfixed at short range by one of
these cartridge-headed arrows. An assortment of the different kind of
arrows is usually carried in the quiver. The lot numbered 25, from
Nuwŭk, which I believe to be a fairly average set, contains two
flint-headed bear arrows, one barbed bear arrow with a steel pile, six
bear arrows with iron piles, one deer arrow, two fowl arrows, and one
bird arrow.</p>

<p>As I have already said, all these arrows are flattened above and
below at the nocks. This indicates that they were intended to be held to
the string and let go after the manner of what is called the “Saxon
release,” namely, by hooking the ends of the index and second fingers
round the string and holding the arrow between them, the string being
released by straightening the fingers. This is the “release” which we
actually saw employed both by the boys and one or two men who showed us
how to draw the bow. This method of release has been observed at
Cumberland Gulf<a class = "tag" name = "tag308" id = "tag308" href =
"#note308">308</a> and at East Cape, Siberia, and is probably universal
among the Eskimo, as all the Eskimo arrows in the National Museum are
fitted for this release. There is ample material in the Museum
collections for a comparative study of Eskimo arrows, which I hope some
day to be able to undertake, when the material is in a more available
condition. One or two references to other regions will not, however, be
out of place. The arrow with a barbed bone after-pile seems a very
general form, being represented in the Museum from most of the Alaskan
regions, as well as from the Mackenzie. Scoresby mentions finding the
head of one of these at the ancient settlements in east Greenland.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag309" id = "tag309" href = "#note309">309</a>
The arrow, however, described by Capt. Parry<a class = "tag" name =
"tag310" id = "tag310" href = "#note310">310</a> has a real foreshaft of
bone, not a barbed after pile. One of these arrows from the Mackenzie
has the after pile barbed on both sides, the only instance,
I&nbsp;believe, in the Museum of a bilaterally-barbed Eskimo arrow where
the pile is not wholly of metal.</p>

<p>The bow and arrows were carried in a bow case and quiver of black
sealskin, tied together side by side and slung across the back in the
same manner as the gun holster already described. We obtained one case
and quiver which belong with the bow and arrows (No.&nbsp;25, from
Nuwŭk) and a single quiver with the bow and arrows (No.&nbsp;234, from
Sidaru.) The case, No. 89245 [25], Fig. 190<i>a</i> (pizĭ´ksĭzax), is of
such a shape that the bow can be carried in it strung and ready for use.
It is made by folding lengthwise a piece of black sealskin with the
flesh side in and sewing up one side “over and over” from the outside.
The bag is wide enough&mdash;6 inches at the widest part&mdash;to allow
the bow to slip in easily when strung, and the small end
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page208" id = "page208">
208</a></span>
is bent up into the shape of the end of the bow. Along the folded edge
are three round holes about 10 inches apart, through which a round stick
was formerly thrust, coming out from the inside through the first hole,
in through the second and out through the third again. This served to
hold the case in shape when the bow was withdrawn, and to its ends were
fastened the thong for slinging it across the shoulders. It was gone
from the specimen before we obtained it.</p>

<p>The quiver (No. 89240-1 [25], Fig. 190<i>b</i>) is a long, straight
bag of the same material, open at one end, with a seam down one side,
and the edge of the mouth opposite to the seam forming a rounded flap 2
inches long. The other end is closed by an elliptical cap of white
tanned seal skin, turned up about 2 inches all round, and crimped round
the ends like a boot sole. Its extreme length is 30 inches, and its
circumference 1 foot. Inside along the seam is a roughly rounded rod of
wood about ½ inch in diameter, with one end, which is pointed,
projecting about 1½ inches through a hole in the bottom, and the other
projecting about 1
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page209" id = "page209">
209</a></span>
inch beyond the mouth, where it is secured by a bit of thong knotted
through a couple of small holes in the bag close to the edge and passing
round a notch on the stick. The stick serves to stiffen the quiver when
there are no arrows in it. A&nbsp;bit of thong is knotted round the
middle, one end being hitched into a loop on the other, for tightening
up the quiver and confining the arrows.</p>

<p>The quiver from Sidaru (No. 72788 [234] Fig. 190<i>c</i>) is like the
preceding, but larger at the bottom than at the mouth. The latter is 8½
inches in circumference and the former 12¾, and the seam is left open
for about 7½ inches from the mouth to facilitate getting at the arrows.
The stiffening rod is made of pine, and does not project through the
bottom or reach the edge of the mouth. It is held in by two pieces of
thong about 10 inches long, which also serve to fasten it to the bow
case. This quiver is nearly new.</p>

<p>It is probable that the form of the bow case and quiver varied but
little, among the American Eskimo at least. Those figured by Capt.
Lyon<a class = "tag" name = "tag311" id = "tag311" href =

Point Barrow, even to the crimped cap on the bottom of the quiver.
A&nbsp;similar set belong with a lad’s bow in the Museum from Point Hope

quiver<a class = "tag" name = "tag312" id = "tag312" href =

<p>Some pains seem to have been bestowed on ornamenting the quiver in
former times, when the bow was in more general use. Fig. 191, No. 56505
[231], from Nuwŭk, represents what we understood had been a stiffening
rod for a quiver or bow case. It is of reindeer antler, 17 inches long,
and one end is very neatly carved into the head and shoulders of a
reindeer, with small, blue glass beads inserted for the eyes. The
lanceolate point at the tip was probably made with an idea of improving
it for sale. The hole at the back of the neck is for a thong to fasten
it on with. A&nbsp;similar reindeer head of antler, Fig. 192, No. 89449
[1066], also from Nuwŭk, seems to have been a cap for a quiver stick.
The back of the neck makes a half-ferrule, in which are three holes for
rivets or treenails.</p>

middle are two straight longitudinal narrow slots, which serve no
apparent purpose except ornament. The short slot near the edge at the
middle of each side, however, is for the thongs which strap the bracer
to the wrist. One of these is short and made into a becket by fastening
the ends together with double slits. One end of the other is passed
through the slot, slit, and the other end passed through this and drawn
taut. A&nbsp;knot is tied on the free end. This thong is just long
enough to fasten on the bracer by passing round the wrist and catching
the knot in the loop opposite. The other, No. 89410<i>a</i> [1233], is
like this, but 1 inch shorter and nearly flat. The arch of the specimen
figured is probably unintentional and due to the natural shape of the
material, as it does not fit well to the wrist. It is probable that
these people used a flat bracer, as Fig. 194, No. 89350 [1382], from
Utkiavwĭñ, is apparently such an implement. It is a thin elliptical
plate of hard bone, 2½ inches long and 1½ wide, with two rows of holes
crossing at right angles in the middle. The holes at the side were
probably for the thong and the others for ornament, as some of them go
only part way through. Four small pebbles are lodged in the four holes
around the center in the form of a cross.</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson collected several specimens of bracers from Kotzebue Sound
and St. Lawrence Island. These are all slightly larger than our
specimens, and bent round to fit the wrist. They are of bone or copper.
When Beechey visited Kotzebue Sound, in 1826, he found the bracer in
general use.<a class = "tag" name = "tag313" id = "tag313" href =

<p>For capturing large birds like ducks or geese, sitting on the water,
especially when they have molted their wing feathers so as to be unable
to escape by flight, they use the universal Eskimo weapon, found from
Greenland to Siberia, namely, a&nbsp;dart with one or more points at the
tip, but carrying a second set of three ivory prongs
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page211" id = "page211">
211</a></span>
in a circle round the middle of the shaft. The object of these prongs is
to increase the chance of hitting the bird if he is missed by the head
of the dart. They always curve forward, so that the points stand out a
few inches from the shaft, and are barbed on the inner edge in such a
way that, though the neck of a fowl will easily pass in between the
prong and the shaft, it is impossible to draw it back again. The weapon
is in very general use at Point Barrow, and is always thrown from the
boat with a handboard (to&nbsp;be described below). It can be darted
with considerable accuracy 20 or 30 yards. We seldom saw this spear
used, as it is chiefly employed in catching molting fowl, in the summer
season, away from the immediate neighborhood of the station. It is
called nuiă´kpai, which is a plural referring to the number of points,
one of which is called nuiă´kpûk (“the great nuiăk”).<a class = "tag"

<p>No. 89244 [1325], Fig. 195, from Utkiavwĭñ, has been selected as the
type of this weapon. The shaft is of spruce, 61⅓ inches long and 0.7
inch in diameter at the head. The end of the butt is hollowed out to fit
the catch of the throwing board. The head, of white walrus ivory, is
fitted into the cleft end of the shaft with a wedge-shaped tang as broad
as the shaft. The head and shaft are held together by a spaced lashing
of braided sinew. To the enlargement of the shaft, 22 inches from the
butt, are fastened three curved prongs of walrus ivory at equal
distances from each other round the shaft. The inner side of each prong
is cut away obliquely for about 2 inches, so that when this edge is
applied to the shaft, with the point of the prong forward, the latter is
about 1 inch from the shaft. Each prong has two little ridges on the
outside, one at the lower end and the other about 1 inch above this.
They are secured to the shaft by three separate lashings of sinew braid,
two narrow ones above the ridges just mentioned and one broad one just
below the barb. In making this the line is knotted round one prong, then
carried one-third of the distance round the shaft to the prong; half
hitched round this, and carried round next the next prong; half hitched
round this, and carried round to the starting point, and half hitched
round
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page212" id = "page212">
212</a></span>
this. It goes around in this way seven times, and then is carried one
prong farther, half hitched again, and the end taken down and made fast
to the first narrow lashing. The shaft is painted with red ocher to
within 13½ inches (the length of the throwing board) from the butt. This
is an old shaft and head fitted with new prongs, and was made by
Nĭkawa´alu, who was anxious to borrow it again when getting ready to
start on his summer trip to the east, where he would find young ducks
and molting fowl.</p>

<p>The form of head seen in this dart appears to be the commonest. It is
called by the same name, nû´tkăñ, as the bone head of the deer arrow.
There is considerable variation in the number of barbs, which are always
bilateral, except in one instance, No. 56590 [122], Fig. 196, from
Utkiavwĭñ, which has four barbs on one side only. It is 7¼ inches long
exclusive of the tang. Out of eight specimens of such heads one has one
pair of barbs, one two pairs, two three pairs, one four unilateral
barbs, one five pairs, one six pairs, and one seven pairs. The total
length of these heads is from 9 inches to 1 foot, of which the tang
makes about 2 inches, and they are generally made of walrus ivory,
wherein they differ from the nugfit of the Greenlanders, which, since
Crantz’s time<a class = "tag" name = "tag315" id = "tag315" href =
"#note315">315</a> has always had a head of iron. Iron is also used at
Cumberland Gulf, as shown by the specimens in the National <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘Musuem’">Museum</ins>. Fig. 197
represents a very ancient spearhead from Utkiavwĭñ, No. 89372 [760]. It
is of compact whale’s bone, darkened with age and impregnated with oil.
It is 8.7 inches long and the other end is beveled off into a
wedge-shaped tang roughened with crosscuts on both faces, with a small
hole for the end of a lashing as on the head of No. 89244 [1325]. This
was called by the native who sold it the head of a seal spear,
ă´kqlĭgûk, and it does bear some slight resemblance to the head of
weapon used in Greenland and called by a similar name<a class = "tag"
name = "tag316" id = "tag316" href = "#note316">316</a> (<ins class =
"correction" title =
"final ‘k’ printed with doubleunderline">agdligaḵ</ins>). The roughened tang, however, indicates that
it was intended to be fixed permanently in the shaft, and this, taken in
connection with its strong resemblance to the one-barbed head of the
Greenland nugfit<a class = "tag" name = "tag317" id = "tag317" href =
"#note317">317</a> as well as to the head of the Siberian bird dart
figured by Nordenskiöld<a class = "tag" name = "tag318" id = "tag318"
href = "#note318">318</a>, makes it probable that it is really the form
of bird dart head anciently used at Point Barrow. It is possible
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page213" id = "page213">
213</a></span>
that this pattern has been so long out of use that the natives have
forgotten what this old point was made for and supposed it to belong to
a seal spear.</p>

<p>One of the eight heads of the ordinary pattern in the collection, No.
56592 [284], a&nbsp;genuine one, old and dirty, is made of
coarse-grained whale’s bone, an unusual material. No. 89373 [948], from
Utkiavwĭñ, an ivory head of a good typical shape, has been figured (Fig.
198) to show a common style of ornamenting these heads. A&nbsp;narrow
incised line, colored with red ocher, runs along the base of the barbs
on each side for about three-fourths the length of the blade. These
heads are sometimes secured by treenails as well as by a simple lashing,
as is shown by the holes through the tang of this specimen.</p>

<p>An improvement on this style of dart, which appears to be less
common, has two prongs at the tip instead of a sharp head, so that the
bird may be caught if struck on the neck with the point of the spear.
No. 89905 [1326], Fig. 199, from Utkiavwĭñ, is one of this pattern. The
two prongs are fastened on with a lashing of fine sinew braid. The rest
of the dart does not differ from the one described except in the method
of attaching the three prongs at the middle (Fig. 199<i>b</i>). These
are fitted into slight grooves in the wood and secured by two neat
lashings of narrow strips of whalebone, one just above a little ridge at
the lower end of each prong and one through little holes in each prong
at the top of the oblique edge. Each lashing consists of several turns
with the end closely wrapped around them. There is one specimen, No.
89242 [526], in the collection which not only has not the prongs at the
middle, but lacks the enlargement of the shaft to receive them. The head
is undoubtedly old and genuine, but the shaft and fittings, though
dirty, look suspiciously fresh. I&nbsp;am inclined to believe that this
head was mounted for sale by a man who had no prongs ready made, and was
in too much of a hurry to get his price to stop to make them. Imperfect
or unfinished objects were frequently offered for sale.</p>

<p>The bird darts used at Point Barrow, and by the western Eskimo
generally, are lighter and better finished than those used in the east.
The latter have a heavy shaft, which is four-sided in Baffin Land, and
the prongs are crooked and clumsy.<a class = "tag" name = "tag319" id =

<p>Fig. 200, No. 89380 [793], is a fragment of a very ancient narwhal
ivory spearhead, dark brown from age and shiny from much handling, which
appears to have been worn as an amulet. It was said to have come from
the east and to belong to a bird dart, though it does not resemble any
in use at the present day in this region. It is a slender four-sided
rod, having on one side three short oblique equidistant simple barbs.
The resemblance of this specimen to the bone dart heads from Scania
figured by Dr. Rau<a class = "tag" name = "tag320" id = "tag320" href =
"#note320">320</a> is very striking.</p>

<p>The Eskimo of nearly all localities use a dart or small harpoon to
capture the smaller marine animals, with a loose, barbed head of bone
fitted into a socket in the end of the shaft, to which it is attached by
a line of greater or less length. It is always contrived so that when
the head is struck into the quarry, the shaft is detached from the head
and acts as a drag upon the animal. This is effected by attaching an
inflated bladder to the shaft, or else by attaching the line with a
martingale so that the shaft is dragged sideways through the water.
Nearly all Eskimo except those of Point Barrow, as shown in the National
Museum collections and the figures in Crantz<a class = "tag" name =
"tag321" id = "tag321" href = "#note321">321</a> and Rink<a class =
"tag" name = "tag322" id = "tag322" href = "#note322">322</a>, use
weapons of this kind of considerable size, adapted not only to the
capture of the small seals (<i>Phoca vitulina</i> and
<i>P.&nbsp;fœtida</i>), but also to the pursuit of the larger seals, the
narwhal and beluga. At Point Barrow, however, at the present day, they
employ only a small form of this dart, not over 5 feet long, with a
little head, adapted only for holding the smallest seals. That they
formerly used the larger weapon is shown by our finding a single
specimen of the head of such a spear, No. 89374 [1281] Fig. 201. It is
of hard, compact bone, impregnated with oil, 8.1 inches long. The flat
shank is evidently intended to fit into a socket. The two holes through
the widest part of the shank are for attaching the line.</p>

<p>This is very like the head of the weapon called <i>agligak</i>
(modern Greenlandic agdligak), figured by Crantz, and referred to above,
except that the barbs are opposite each other. Mr. Lucien M.&nbsp;Turner
tells me that it is precisely like the head of the dart used at Norton
Sound for capturing the beluga. The native who sold this specimen called
it “nuiă´kpai nû´tkoa,” “the point of a bird dart,” to which it does
bear some resemblance, though the shape of the butt and the line holes
indicate plainly that it was a <i>detachable</i> dart head. Probably, as
in the case of the ancient bird dart point, No. 89372 [760], referred to
above, this weapon has been so long disused that the natives have <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘forgotton’">forgotten</ins>
what it was. The name ă´kqlĭgûk, evidently the same as the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page215" id = "page215">
215</a></span>
Greenlandic <i>agdligak</i>, is still in use, but was always applied to
the old bone harpoon heads, which are, however, of the toggle-head
pattern (described below). It seems as if the Point Barrow natives had
forgotten all about the ă´kqlĭgûk except that it was a harpoon with a
bone head for taking seals. At the present time the small bladder float,
permanently attached to the shaft of the harpoon, is never used at Point
Barrow. That it was used in ancient times is shown by our finding in one
of the ruined houses in Utkiavwĭñ a very old broken nozzle for inflating
one of these floats. Fig. 202, No. 89720 [756], is this specimen, which
was picked up by Capt. Herendeen. This is a rounded tube of fossil
ivory, 1.3 inches long and about one-half inch in diameter, slightly
contracted toward one end and then expanded into a stout collar. At the
other is a stout longitudinal flange, three-fourths inch long,
perforated with an oblong slot. Between the flange and the collar the
surface is roughened with crosscuts, and the other end is still choked
with the remains of a wooden plug. This nozzle was inserted into a hole
in the bladder as far as the flange and secured by tying the bladder
above the collar. The whole was then secured to the shaft by a lashing
through the slot, and could be inflated at pleasure and corked up with
the wooden plug.</p>

<p>As I have already said, the only harpoon of this kind now used at
Point Barrow is a small one intended only for the capture of small
seals. It has no bladder, but the rather long line is attached to the
shaft by a martingale which makes the shaft drag sideways through the
water. Three of these little darts, which are thrown with a handboard
like the bird dart, make a set. The resistance of the shafts
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page216" id = "page216">
216</a></span>
of these three spears darted into the seal in succession is said to be
sufficient to fatigue the seal so that he can be easily approached and
dispatched. We never saw these weapons used, though they are very
common, as they are intended only for use from the kaiak, which these
people seldom use in the neighborhood of the villages. When in the
<i>umiak</i>, shooting with the rifle is a more expeditious means of
taking seals. We collected three sets of these darts (kúkigû).</p>

<p>No. 89249<i>b</i> [523], Fig. 203, has been selected for description.
The shaft is of spruce, 54½ inches long, and 0.8 inch in diameter at the
tip, tapering slightly almost to the butt, which is hollowed on the end
to fit the catch of the throwing board. The foreshaft is of white walrus
ivory 5 inches long, and is fitted into the tip of the shaft with a
wedge-shaped tang. This foreshaft, which has a deep oblong slot to
receive the head in the middle of its flat tip, serves the double
purpose of making a strong solid socket for the head and giving
sufficient weight to the end of the dart to make it fly straight. The
head is a simple flat barbed arrowhead of hard bone 2.3 inches long and
one-half inch broad across the barbs, with a flat tang, broadest in the
middle, where there is a hole for attaching the line. This head simply
serves to attach the drag of the shaft to the seal as it is too small to
inflict a serious wound. It is fastened to the shaft by a martingale
made as follows: One end of a stout line of sinew braid 5½ feet long is
passed through the hole in the head and secured by tying a knot in the
end. The other end of this line divides into two parts not quite so
stout, one 3 feet long, the other 2 feet 8 inches. The latter is
fastened to the shaft 18½ inches from the butt by a single marling hitch
with the end wedged into a slit in the wood and seized down with fine
sinew. The longer part serves to fasten the foreshaft to the shaft, and
was probably put on separately and worked into the braiding of the rest
of the line at the junction. The foreshaft is kept from slipping out by
a little transverse ridge on each side of the tang. When the weapon is
mounted for use the two parts of the bridle are brought together at the
middle of the shaft and wrapped spirally around it till only enough line
is left to permit the head to be inserted in the socket, and the bight
of the line is secured by tucking it under the last turn. When a seal is
struck with this dart his sudden plunge to escape unships the head. The
catch of the martingale immediately slips; the latter unrolls and drags
the shaft through the water at right angles to the line. The shaft,
besides acting as a drag on the seal’s motions, also serves as a float
to indicate his position to the hunter, as its buoyancy brings it to the
surface before the seal when the latter rises for air.</p>

<p>The shaft is usually painted red except so much of the end as lies in
the groove of the throwing-board, in the act of darting. These darts
vary but little in size and material, and are all of essentially the
same pattern. They are always about 5 feet in length when mounted for
use. (The longest is 64⅓ inches, and the shortest&nbsp;57.) The head, as
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page217" id = "page217">
217</a></span>
well as the foreshaft, is sometimes made of walrus ivory, and the latter
sometimes of whale’s bone. The chief variation is in the length of the
martingale, and the details of the method of attaching it. No two are
precisely alike. The foreshaft is generally plain, but is occasionally
highly ornamented, as is shown in Fig. 204, No. 56516 [105]. The figures
are all incised and colored, some with ocher and some with soot.</p>

<p>Both of the kinds of darts above described are thrown by means of a
hand board or throwing-board. This is a flat, narrow board, from 15 to
18 inches long, with a handle at one end and a groove along the upper
surface in which the spear lies with the butt resting against a catch at
the other end. The dart is propelled by a quick motion of the wrist, as
in casting with a fly-rod, which swings up the tip of the board and
launches the dart forward. This contrivance, which practically makes of
the hand a lever 18 inches long, enables the thrower by a slight motion
of the wrist to impart great velocity to the dart. The use of this
implement is universal among the Eskimo, though not peculiar to them.
The Greenlanders, however, not only use it for the two kinds of darts
already mentioned, but have adapted it to the large harpoon.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag323" id = "tag323" href = "#note323">323</a> This is
undoubtedly to adapt the large harpoon for use from the kaiak, which the
Greenlanders use more habitually than most other Eskimo. On the other
hand, the people of Baffin Land and the adjoining regions, as well as
the inhabitants of northeastern Siberia, use it only with the bird
dart.<a class = "tag" name = "tag324" id = "tag324" href =

<p>We obtained five specimens of the form used at Point Barrow. No.
89233 [523], Fig. 205<i>a</i>, belonging to the set of seal darts
bearing the same collector’s number, has been selected as the type. This
is made of spruce, and the hole is for the forefinger. A&nbsp;little peg
of walrus ivory, shaped like a flat-headed nail, is driven through the
middle of the tip so that the edge of the head just projects into the
groove. This fits into the hollow in the butt of the dart and serves to
steady it. It is painted red on the back and sides. Fig. 205<i>b</i>,
No. 89235 [60], differs from this in having a double curve instead of
being flat. A&nbsp;slight advantage is gained by this as in a crooked
lever. The catch is a small iron nail. The others are essentially the
same as the type. No. 89234 [528], has a small brass screw for the
catch, and No. 89902 [1326], has an ivory peg of a slightly different
shape, the head having only a projecting point on one side. They are
generally painted with red ocher except on the inside of the groove.
There appears to be no difference between throwing-boards meant for seal
darts and those used with the bird dart.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I had no opportunity of observing accurately how the
handle was grasped, but it is probably held as seen by Beechey at
Eschscholtz Bay,<a class = "tag" name = "tag326" id = "tag326" href =
"#note326">326</a> namely, with the forefinger in the hole, the thumb
and middle finger clasped round the spear, and the third and little
fingers clasping the handle under the spear. This seems a very natural
way of holding it. Of course, the fingers release the spear at the
moment of casting. All the throwing-boards from Point Barrow are
right-handed.</p>

<p>All kinds of marine animals, including the smaller seals, which are
also captured with the darts just described and with nets, are pursued
with harpoons of the same general type, but of different patterns for
the different animals. They may be divided into two classes&mdash;those
intended for throwing, which come under the head of projectile weapons,
and those which do not leave the hand, but are thrust into the animal.
These fall properly under the head of thrusting weapons. Both classes
agree in having the head only attached permanently to the line, fitted
loosely to the end of the shaft, and arranged so that when struck into
the animal it is detached from the shaft, and turns under the skin at
right angles to the line, like a toggle, so that it is almost impossible
for it to draw out.</p>

<p>No. 89793 [873], Fig. 206, is a typical toggle head of this kind,
intended for a walrus harpoon (túkɐ), and will be described in full, as
the names of the different parts will apply to all heads of this class.
The <i>body</i> is a conoidal piece, 4½ inches in length, and flattened
laterally so that at the widest part it is 1 inch wide and 0.7 thick. On
one side, which may be called the <i>lower</i>, it is cut off straight
for about half the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page219" id = "page219">
219</a></span>
longer diameter, while the upper side is produced into a long,
four-sided spur, the <i>barb</i>. The <i>line hole</i> is a round hole
about one-fourth inch in diameter, a&nbsp;little back of the middle of
the body, at right angles to its longer diameter. From this, on each
side, run shallow <i>line grooves</i> to the base of the body, gradually
deepening as they run into the line hole. In the middle of the base of
the body is the deep, cup-shaped <i>shaft-socket</i>, which fits the
conical tip of the shaft or fore shaft. In the tip of the body is cut,
at right angles to the longer diameter of the body, and therefore at
right angles to the plane of the barb, the narrow <i>blade slit</i>, 1.1
inches deep, into which fits, secured by a single median rivet of
whalebone, the flat, thin <i>blade</i> of metal (brass in this case).
This is triangular, with curved edges, narrowly beveled on both faces,
and is 1.9 inches long and 1 broad.</p>

<p>The body is sometimes cut into faces so as to be hexagonal instead of
elliptical in section as in Fig. 207 (No.&nbsp;89791 [873]), and
intermediate forms are common. When such a head is mounted for use a
bight of the line or <i>leader</i>, a short line for connecting the head
with the main line, runs through the line hole so that the head is slung
in a loop in the end of the line. The tip of the shaft is then fitted
into the shaft socket and the line brought down the shaft with the parts
of the loop on each side resting in the line grooves and is made fast,
usually so that a slight pull will detach it from the shaft. When the
animal is struck the blade cuts a wound large enough to allow the head
to pass in beyond the barb. The struggles of the animal make the head
slip off the tip of the shaft and the strain on the line immediately
toggles it across the wound. The toggle head of the whale harpoon is
called kia¢ron, of the walrus harpoon, tukɐ, and of the seal harpoon,
naulɐ. They are all of essentially the same pattern, differing chiefly
in size.</p>

<p>There is in the collection an interesting series of old harpoon
heads, showing a number of steps in the development of the modern
pattern of harpoon head from an ancient form. These heads seem to have
been preserved as amulets; in fact one of them is still attached to a
belt. They are not all of the same kind, but since the different kinds
as mentioned above practically differ only in size, their development
was probably the same. The earliest form in the collection is No. 89382
[1383], Fig. 208, from Nuwŭk, which is evidently very old, as it is much
worn and weathered. It is a single flat piece of fine-grained bone 3
inches long, pointed at the end and provided with a single unilateral
barb.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page220" id = "page220">
220</a></span>
Behind this it is narrowed and then widened into a broad flat base
produced on one side into a sharp barb, in the same plane as the other
barb, which represents the blade, but on the opposite side. The line
hole is large and irregularly triangular, and there are no line grooves.
Instead of a shaft socket bored in the solid body, one side of the body
is excavated into a deep longitudinal groove, which was evidently
converted into a socket by a transverse band, probably of sealskin,
running round the body, and kept in place by a shallow transverse groove
on the convex side of it. A&nbsp;harpoon head with the socket made by
inclosing a groove with thongs was seen by Dr. Kane at Smith Sound.<a

</div>

<p>The next form, No. 89331 [932], Fig. 209<i>a</i>, has two bilateral
barbs to the blade part, thus increasing its holding power. Instead of
an open transverse groove to hold the thong, it has two slots parallel
to the socket groove running obliquely to the other side, where they
open into a shallow depression. Figs. 209<i>b</i> and 210, Nos. 89544
[1419] and 89377 [766], are variants of this form, probably intended for
the larger seal, as the blade part is very long in proportion. No. 89544
[1419] is interesting from its close resemblance to the spear head
figured by Nordenskiöld<a class = "tag" name = "tag328" id = "tag328"
href = "#note328">328</a> from the ancient “Onkilon” house at North
Cape. No. 89377 [766] is a peculiar form, which was perhaps not general,
as it has left no descendants among the modern harpoon. Instead of the
bilateral blade barbs it has an irregular slot on each side, which
evidently served to hold a blade of stone, and the single barb of the
body is replaced by a cluster of four, which are neither in the plane of
the blade nor at right angles to it, but between the two. No modern
harpoon heads from Point Barrow have more than two barbs on the body.
The next improvement was to bore the shaft socket instead of making it
by inclosing a groove with thongs. This is shown in Fig. 211
(No.&nbsp;89379 [795], from Utkiavwĭñ), which is just like No. 89544
[1419] except in this respect. The line grooves first appear at this
stage of the development.</p>

221</a></span>
<p>The next step was to obtain greater penetration by substituting a
triangular blade of stone for the barbed bone point, with its breadth
still in the plane of the body barb. This blade was either of slate
(No.&nbsp;89744 [969] from Nuwŭk) or of flint, as in Fig. 212
(No.&nbsp;89748 [928], also from Nuwŭk). Both of these are whale
harpoons, such as are sometimes used even at the present day.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of iron it was discovered that if the blade
were inserted at right angles to the plane of the body barb the harpoon
would have a surer hold, since the strain on the line would always draw
it at right angles to the length of the wound cut by the blade. This is
shown in Fig. 213 (No.&nbsp;56620 [199], a&nbsp;walrus harpoon head from
Utkiavwĭñ), which has the slate blade inserted in this position.
Substituting a metal blade for the stone one gives us the modern toggle
head, as already described. That the insertion of the stone blade
preceded the rotation of the plane of the latter is, I&nbsp;think,
conclusively shown by the whale harpoons<a class = "tag" name = "tag329"
id = "tag329" href = "#note329">329</a> already mentioned, in spite of
the fact that we have a bone harpoon head in the collection, No. 89378
[1261], figured in Point Barrow report, which is exactly like No. 89379
[795], except that it has the blade <i>at right angles</i> to the plane
of the body barb. This is, however, a&nbsp;newly made model in reindeer
antler of the ancient harpoon, and was evidently made by a man so used
to the modern pattern that he forgot this important distinction. The
development of this spear head has been carried no further at Point
Barrow. At one or two places, however, namely, at Cumberland Gulf in the
east<a class = "tag" name = "tag330" id = "tag330" href =
"#note330">330</a> and at Sledge Island in the west (as&nbsp;shown in
Mr. Nelson’s collection), they go a step further in making the head of
the seal harpoon, body and blade, of one piece of iron. The shape,
however, is the same as those with the ivory or bone body.</p>

<p>All of the Eskimo race, as far as I have any definite information,
use toggle harpoon-heads. There are specimens in the National Museum
from Greenland, Cumberland Gulf, the Anderson and Mackenzie region, and
from the Alaskan coast from Point Barrow to Kadiak, as well as from St.
Lawrence Island, which are all of essentially the same type, but
slightly modified in different localities. The harpoon head in use at
Smith Sound is of the same form as the walrus harpoon heads used at
Point Barrow, but appears always to have the shaft socket made by a
groove closed with thongs.<a class = "tag" name = "tag331" id = "tag331"
href = "#note331">331</a> In Danish Greenland, however, the body has an
extra pair of bilateral barbs below the blade. The Greenlanders have, as
it were, substituted a metal blade for the point only of the barbed
blade portion of such a bone head as No. 89379 [795].<a class = "tag"
name = "tag332" id = "tag332" href = "#note332">332</a></p>

<p>Curiously enough, this form of the toggle head appears again in the
Mackenzie and Anderson region, as shown by the extensive collections of
Ross, MacFarlane, and others. In this region the metal blade itself is
often cut into one or more pairs of bilateral barbs. At the Straits of
Fury and Hecla, Parry found the harpoon head, with a body like the
walrus harpoon heads at Point Barrow,<a class = "tag" name = "tag333" id
= "tag333" href = "#note333">333</a> but with the blade <i>in the
plane</i> of the body barb. Most of the pictures scattered through the
work represent the blade in this position, but Fig. 19 on the same plate
has the blade at right angles to the barb, so that the older form may
not be universal. At Cumberland Gulf the form of the body is
considerably modified, though the blade is of the usual shape and in the
ordinary position. The body is flattened at right angles to the usual
direction, so that the thickness is much greater than the width. It
always has two body barbs. On the western coast the harpoon heads are
much less modified, though there is a tendency to increase the number of
body barbs, at the same time ornamenting the body more elaborately as we
go south from Bering Strait. Walrus harpoon heads with a single barb,
hardly distinguishable from those used at Point Barrow, are in the
collection from the Diomedes and all along the northern shore of Norton
Sound, and one also from the mouth of the Kuskoquim. They are probably
also used from Point Barrow to Kotzebue Sound. At St. Lawrence Island
and on the Asiatic shore they are the common if not the universal
form.<a class = "tag" name = "tag334" id = "tag334" href =
"#note334">334</a> The seal harpoon head (naulɐ) at Point Barrow appears
always to have the body barb split at the tip into two, and this is the
case rarely with the tu´kɐ. This form, which appears occasionally north
of Norton Sound (Port Clarence, Cape Nome), appears to be more common
south of this locality, where, however, a&nbsp;pattern with the barb
divided into three points seems to be the prevailing form. I&nbsp;will
now proceed to the description of the different forms of harpoon with
which these toggle heads are used.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page223" id = "page223">
223</a></span>
<p>Throwing-harpoons are always thrown from the hand without a
throwing-board or other assistance, and are of two sizes, one for the
walrus and bearded seal, and one for the small seals. Both have a long
shaft of wood to the tip of which is attached a heavy bone or ivory
foreshaft, usually of greater diameter than the shaft and somewhat
club-shaped. This serves the special purpose of giving weight to the
head of the harpoon, so it can be darted with a sure aim. The native
name of this part of the spear, ukumailuta (Greenlandic, okimailutaĸ,
<i>weight</i>), indicates its design. This contrivance of weighting the
head of the harpoon with a heavy foreshaft is peculiar to the western
Eskimo. On all the eastern harpoons (see figures referred to above and
the Museum collections) the foreshaft is a simple cap of bone no larger
than the shaft the tip of which it protects. Between the foreshaft and
the toggle-head is interposed the <i>loose shaft</i> (i´gimû),
a&nbsp;slender rod of bone whose tip fits into the shaft socket of the
head, while its butt fits loosely in a socket in the tip of the
foreshaft. It is secured to the shaft by a thong just long enough to
allow it to be unshipped from the foreshaft. This not only prevents the
loose shaft from breaking under a lateral strain, but by its play
facilitates unshipping the head. On these harpoons intended for
throwing, this loose shaft is always short. This brings the weight of
the foreshaft close to the head, while it leaves space enough for the
head to penetrate beyond the barb.</p>

<p>The walrus harpoon varies in size, being adapted to the strength and
stature of the owner. Of the six in our collection, the longest, when
mounted for use, is 9 feet 6 inches long, and the shortest 5 feet 8
inches. The ordinary length appears to be about 7 feet. It has a long,
heavy shaft (ipua) of wood, usually between 5 and 6 feet long and
tapering from a diameter of 1½ inches at the head to about 1 inch at the
butt. The head is not usually fastened directly to the line, but has a
leader of double thong 1 to 2 feet long, with a becket at the end into
which the main line is looped or hitched. At the other end of the line,
which is about 30 feet long, is another becket to which is fastened a
float consisting of a whole sealskin inflated. When the head is fitted
on the tip of the loose shaft the line is brought down to the middle of
the shaft and hooked by means of a little becket to an ivory peg
(ki´lerbwĭñ) projecting from the side of the shaft. The eastern Eskimo
have, in place of the simple becket, a&nbsp;neat little contrivance
consisting of a plate of ivory lashed to the line with a large slot in
it which hooks over the catch, but nothing of the sort was observed at
Point Barrow.</p>

<p>The harpoon thus mounted is poised in the right hand with the
forefinger resting against a curved ivory projection (ti´ka) and darted
like a white man’s harpoon, the float and line being thrown overboard at
the same time. When a walrus is struck the head slips off and toggles as
already described; the line detaches itself from the catch, leaving the
shaft free to float and be picked up. The float is now fastened to the
walrus, and, like the shaft of the seal dart, both shows his whereabouts
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page224" id = "page224">
224</a></span>
and acts as a drag on his movements until he is “played” enough for the
hunters to come up and dispatch him. This weapon is called u´nakpûk,
“the great u´na or spear.” U´na (unâk, u´nañ) appears to be a generic
term in Eskimo for harpoon, but at Point Barrow is now restricted to the
harpoon used for stabbing seals as they come up to their breathing
holes.</p>

<p>We collected six of these walrus harpoons complete and forty-two
separate heads. Of these, No. 56770 [534], Fig. 214<i>a</i>, has the
most typical shaft and loose shaft. The shaft is of spruce 71 inches
long, roughly rounded, and tapering from a diameter of 1½ inches at the
tip to 0.8 at the butt. The foreshaft is of white walrus ivory, 6.7
inches long, exclusive of the wedge-shaped tang which fits into a cleft
in the tip of the shaft. It is somewhat club-shaped, being 1.6 inches in
diameter at the tip and tapering to 1.3 just above the butt, which
expands to the diameter of the shaft, and is separated from the tang by
a square transverse shoulder. The shaft and foreshaft are fastened
together by a whipping of broad seal thong, put on wet, one end passing
through a hole in the foreshaft one-quarter inch from the shaft, and
kept from slipping by a low transverse ridge on each side of the tang.
In the tip of the foreshaft is a deep, round socket to receive the loose
shaft, which is a tapering rod of walrus ivory 4.4 inches long,
shouldered off at the butt, which is 0.7 inch in diameter, to a blunt,
rounded tang 0.9 inch long. It fits loosely into the foreshaft up to the
shoulder, and is secured by a piece of narrow seal thong which passes
through a transverse hole one-half inch above the shoulder. The end is
spliced to the standing part with double slits about 6 inches from the
loose shaft, and the other end makes a couple of turns outside of the
lashing on the shaft mentioned above and is secured with two
half-hitches.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 214.&mdash;Walrus harpoons.</p>
</div>

<p>The line catch (ki´lerbwĭñ) is a little, blunt, backward-pointing
hook of ivory inserted in the shaft 17 inches from the tip and
projecting about one-third inch. Ten and one-fourth inches farther back
and 90
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page225" id = "page225">
225</a></span>
degrees round the shaft from the line catch is the finger rest&mdash;a
conical recurved piece of ivory 1 inch high, with a flat base, resting
against the shaft and secured by a lashing of whalebone, which passes
through two corresponding holes, one in the rest and one in the shaft.
The head and line belonging to this harpoon are intended for hunting the
bearded seal, and will be described below. No. 56772 [536], Fig.
214<i>b</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ, is fitted with fairly typical walrus gear.
The head is of the typical form, 6&nbsp;inches long, with a conoidal
body of walrus ivory, ornamented with incised lines colored with red
ocher, and a blade of steel secured by a whalebone rivet. The “leader,”
which is about 15 inches long, is made by passing one end of a piece of
stout walrus-hide thong about one-quarter inch wide through the line
hole and doubling it with the head in the bight, so that one part is
about 6 inches the longer. The two parts are stopped together about 2
inches from the head with a bit of sinew braid. The ends are joined and
made into a becket, as follows: The longer end is doubled back for 7
inches and a slit cut through both parts about 2 inches from the end.
The shorter end is passed through this slit, and a slit is cut 5 inches
from the end of this, through which the loop of the other end is passed
and all drawn taut. The whole joint is then tightly seized with sinew
braid so as to leave a becket 3 inches and a free end 4 inches long.
This becket is looped into an eye 1½ inches long at the end of the main
line, made by doubling over 5 inches of the end and stopping the two
parts firmly together with sinew braid. The line is of the hide of the
bearded seal, about the same diameter as the leader, and 27 feet long.
It is in two nearly equal parts, spliced together with double slits,
firmly seized with sinew braid. There is a becket about 8 inches long at
the other end of the line for attaching the float, made by doubling over
the end and tying a carrick bend, the end of which is stopped back to
the standing part with sinew braid. The becket to hook upon the line
catch is a bit of sinew braid, fastened to the line 2½ feet from the
head, as follows: One end being laid against the line it is doubled in a
bight and the end is whipped down to the line by the other end, which
makes five turns round them.</p>

<p>I will now consider the variations of the different parts of these
harpoons in detail, beginning with the head. Our series is so large,
containing in all forty-eight heads, besides some spare blades, that it
probably gives a fair representation of the common variations. The
longest of this series is 6 inches long and the shortest 3½, but by far
the greater number are from 4½ to 5 inches long. Their proportions are
usually about as in the types figured, but the long head just figured
(No.&nbsp;56772 [534]) is also unusually slender. Sheet brass is the
commonest material for the blade (thirty blades are of this material),
though iron or steel is sometimes used, and rarely, at present, slate.
There is one slate-bladed head in the series (No.&nbsp;56620 [199])
figured above, and four blades for such heads. The blade is commonly of
the shape of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page226" id = "page226">
226</a></span>
type figured, triangular with curved edges, varying from a rather long
triangle like the slate blade just mentioned to a rather short one with
very strongly curved edges like Fig. 215<i>a</i> (No.&nbsp;89750
[1038]), which is peculiar as the only walrus harpoon head with a body
of reindeer antler. It also has an iron blade and a rivet of iron, not
seldom with rounded basal angles so as to be almost heart-shaped, like
Fig. 215<i>b</i> (No.&nbsp;56621 [283]). A&nbsp;less common shape of
blade is lanceolate, with the base cut off square as in Fig. 216<i>a</i>
(No.&nbsp;89764 [940]). Only eight blades out of the series are of this
shape. A&nbsp;still more peculiar shape of blade, of which we saw only
one specimen, is shown in Fig. 216<i>b</i> (No.&nbsp;89790 [943]). This
is made of brass. It was perhaps meant for an imitation of the barbed
blades used at the Mackenzie, of which I have already spoken.</p>

<p>The blade, when of metal, is generally fastened in with a single
rivet. One only out of the whole number has two rivets, and three are
simply wedged into the blade slit. The slate blades appear never to have
been riveted; Nordenskiöld, however, figures a walrus harpoon from Port
Clarence<a class = "tag" name = "tag335" id = "tag335" href =
"#note335">335</a> with a jade blade riveted in. The rivet is generally
made of whalebone, but other materials are sometimes used. For instance,
in the series collected two have rivets of iron, two of wood, and five
of rawhide. The body is generally made of white walrus ivory, (five of
those collected are of hard bone, and one already mentioned and figured,
No. 89750 [1038], Fig. 215<i>a</i>, is of reindeer antler), and the
hexagonal shape, often with rounded edges, and the line grooves
continued to the tip, as in Fig. 217<i>a</i>, No. 89757 [947], appears
to be the commonest. Three out of the forty-eight have four-sided
bodies. It is unusual for the body barb to be bifurcated, as is common
farther south.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page227" id = "page227">
227</a></span>
Only three out of the forty-eight show this peculiarity, of which No.
56613 [53], Fig. 217<i>b</i>, is an example.</p>

<p>The specimens figured show the different styles of ornamentation,
which always consist of incised patterns colored with red ocher or
rarely with soot. These never represent natural objects, but are always
conventional patterns, generally a single or double border on two or
more faces with short oblique cross-lines and branches. Harpoon heads at
Point Barrow are probably never ornamented with the “circles and dots,”
so common on other implements and on the harpoons of the southern
Eskimo.</p>

heads.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight of the heads still have the leaders attached to them.
The object of this short line is to enable the hunter to readily detach
a broken head and put on a fresh one without going to the trouble of
undoing a splice, which must be made strong to keep the head from
separating from the line. It is made of a stout piece of rawhide thong,
the skin of the walrus or bearded seal, about one-third inch in
diameter, and usually from 2 to 3 feet long. It is always passed through
the line hole, as in the specimen described, and the ends are made into
a becket for attaching the line, with an end left to serve as a handle
for pulling the two beckets apart when the main line ends in a becket.
Occasionally (two are made this way) the longer end is simply doubled in
a bight, and the three parts are then seized together with sinew braid,
but it is generally made with a splice, the details of which differ
slightly on the different leaders.</p>

<p>The commonest method is that already described. When the longer end
is doubled over, a&nbsp;slit is cut through both parts close to the end
of this through which the shorter end is passed. A&nbsp;slit is then cut
a few inches from the tip of this part, the bight of the becket passed
through this slit and all drawn taut. This makes a very strong splice.
Fourteen beckets are spliced in this way. A&nbsp;variation of this
splice has a slit only through the end part of the longer end, the
shorter end being passed through and slit as before. In one becket the
standing part of the longer end is passed through the slit of the end
part before going through the line hole, while the rest of the becket is
made as before. A&nbsp;reversed splice is found on three of the leaders,
which is made as follows: When the long end is doubled over, the short
end is slit as usual and the longer end passed through this and slit
close to the tip. Through this slit is passed the head and all drawn
taut. The splice is always firmly seized with sinew braid. The main
line, which serves to attach the head to the float, is always made of
stout thong, preferably the skin of the bearded seal (very fine lines
are sometimes made of beluga skin), about one-third inch square, and,
when properly made, trimmed off on the edges so as to be almost round.
It is about 10 yards long. It is fastened into the becket of the leader
with a becket hitch tied upside down (No.&nbsp;56771 [535], Fig. 218),
or by means of a small becket, made either as on the specimen described
(No.&nbsp;56770 [536], Fig. 219), or spliced with double slits. The long
becket at the other end for attaching
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page229" id = "page229">
229</a></span>
the float is made either by tying a carrick bend with the end stopped
back to the standing part (Fig. 220, No. 56767 [531]), or by splicing
(Fig. 221, No. 56769).</p>

</div>

<p>The loose shaft varies very little in shape, though it is sometimes
rounded off at the butt without a shoulder, but the line which secures
this to the foreshaft is put on differently on each of the six spears.
Five of them have the end simply passed through the hole in the loose
shaft and spliced to the standing part, but two (the type figured and
No. 56768 [532]) have the other end carried down and hitched round the
tip of the shaft; another has it passed through a hole in the foreshaft,
taken 1½ turns round this and knotted (No.&nbsp;56771 [535]); another
has a loop as long as the foreshaft with the short end passed under the
first turn of the shaft lashing before it is spliced, and the long end
secured as on the first mentioned; and the fifth has the end passed
through a hole in the foreshaft and carried down and wrapped round the
shaft lashing. The sixth has one end passed through a hole in the
smallest part of the foreshaft and knotted at the end, the other end
carried up through the hole in the loose shaft and down to a second hole
in the foreshaft close to the first, then up through the loose shaft,
and down through the first hole, and tucked under the two parts on the
other side.</p>

<p>The foreshaft is made of walrus ivory or the hard bone of the walrus
jaw and varies little in form and dimensions. It is sometimes ornamented
by carving, as in No. 56772 [536], or by incised patterns, as in Fig.
222, No. 56538 [98], and generally has one or two deep longitudinal
notches in the thickest part, in which the lines can be drawn snugly
down. It usually is joined to the shaft by a stout, wedge-shaped tang,
which fits into a corresponding cleft in the shaft, and is secured by
wooden treenails and a wrapping of seal thong or sinew braid, sometimes
made more secure by passing
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page230" id = "page230">
230</a></span>
one end through holes in the foreshaft. No. 56768 [532] is peculiar in
having the tang on the shaft and the corresponding cleft in the
foreshaft. The shaft itself varies little in shape and proportions, and
at the present day is sometimes made of ash or other hard wood obtained
from the ships. The line catch is generally a little hook of ivory or
hard bone like the one described, but two specimens have small screws
fastened into the shaft to serve this purpose. The finger rest is
ordinarily of the same shape as on the type and fastened on in the same
way, but No. 56771 [535] has this made of a knob of ivory elaborately
carved into a seal’s head. The eyes are represented by round bits of
ivory with pupils drilled in them inlaid in the head. This is evidently
the knob of a seal drag (see below) as the longitudinal perforation from
chin to nape now serves no purpose. It is fastened on by a lashing of
whalebone, which runs round the shaft and through a transverse hole in
the knob.</p>

seals.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Harpoons closely resembling these in type are used by the Eskimo of
western North America wherever they habitually hunt the walrus. At many
places this heavy spear is armed at the butt with a long sharp pick of
ivory like the smaller seal spear. Two of these large harpoons appear to
be rigged especially for the pursuit of the bearded seal, as they have
heads which are of precisely the same shape and material as the small
seal harpoons in the collection. Both these heads have lanceolate iron
blades, conoidal antler bodies with double barbs, and are more slender
than the walrus harpoon heads. No. 56770 [534], Fig. 219, has a head 4
inches long and 0.7 broad at the widest part, and fastened to a very
long line (12&nbsp;fathoms long) without a leader, the end being simply
passed through the line hole and seized down to the standing part with
sinew braid. This is the method of attaching the head of the small seal
harpoons. This line is so long that it may have been held in the boat
and not attached to a float. No. 56768 [532], however, has a leader with
a becket of the ordinary style. Fig. 223, No. 56611 [89], is a head
similar to those just described, and probably, from its size, intended
for large seals. It is highly ornamented with the usual reddened incised
pattern.</p>

<p>The throwing harpoon for small seals is an exact copy in miniature of
the walrus harpoon, with the addition of a long bayonet-shaped pick of
ivory at the butt. The line, however, is upwards of 30 yards long, and
the end never leaves the hand. The line is hitched round the shaft back
of the line catch, which now only serves to keep the line from slipping
forward, as the shaft is never detached from the line. This harpoon is
used exclusively
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page231" id = "page231">
231</a></span>
for retrieving seals that have been shot in open holes or leads of water
within darting distance from the edge of the solid ice, and is thrown
precisely as the walrus harpoon is, except that the end of the line is
held in the left hand. In traveling over the ice the line with the head
attached is folded in long hanks and slung on the gun case at the back.
The rest of the weapon is carried in the hand and serves as a staff in
walking and climbing among the ice, where the sharp pick is useful to
prevent slipping and to try doubtful ice, and also enables the hunter to
break away thin ice at the edge of the hole, so as to draw his game up
to the solid floe. It can also serve as a bayonet in case of necessity.
This peculiar form of harpoon is confined to the coast from Point Barrow
to Bering Strait, the only region where the seal is hunted with the
rifle in the small open holes of water.<a class = "tag" name = "tag336"
id = "tag336" href = "#note336">336</a></p>

<p>Since my note in the Naturalist was written, I have learned from Mr.
Henry Balfour, of the museum at Oxford, that their collection contains
two or three specimens of this very pattern of harpoon, undoubtedly
collected by some of the officers of the <i>Blossom</i>. Consequently,
my theory that the retrieving harpoon was a modern invention, due to the
introduction of firearms, becomes untenable, as the <i>Blossom</i>
visited this region before firearms were known to the Eskimo. It was
probably originally intended for the capture of seals “hauled out” on
the ice in the early summer. There is no doubt, however, that it is at
the present day used for nothing but retrieving.</p>

seal harpoon.</p>

</div>

<p>Though this weapon was universally used at Point Barrow, we happened
to obtain only two specimens, possibly because the natives thought them
too necessary an implement to part with lightly. No. 89907 [1695], Figs.
224, 225, has a new shaft, etc., but was used several times by the maker
before it was offered for sale. Such a retrieving harpoon is called
naúlĭgɐ. The shaft (ipúa) is of ash, 4&nbsp;feet 5 inches long and 1
inch in diameter, tapering very slightly to each end. The ice pick (túu)
of walrus ivory, 14 inches long and 1 inch wide, has a round tang
fitting into a hole in the butt of the shaft. Close to the shaft a small
hole is drilled in one edge of the pick, and through this is passed a
bit of seal thong, the ends of which are laid along the shaft and neatly
whipped down with sinew braid, with the end wedged into a slit in the
wood.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page232" id = "page232">
232</a></span>
The foreshaft (ukumailuta) is of walrus ivory, 4½ inches long and 1½
inches in diameter at the thickest part, and secured to the shaft by a
whipping (nĭ´mxa) of seal thong. The loose shaft (ígimû) is also of
ivory and 2 inches long and secured by a thong (ĭpíuta) spliced into a
loop through the hole at the butt, as previously described. The end is
hitched round the tip of the shaft with a marling hitch, followed by a
clove hitch below the whipping. The ivory finger rest (ti´ka) is
fastened on with a lashing of whip cord (white man’s) passing round the
shaft. The line catch (ki´lerbwĭñ), which was of ivory and shaped like
those on the walrus harpoons, has been lost in transportation. The head
differs only in size from those just described as intended for the
bearded seal, except in having a hexagonal body. It is 3.3 inches long
and has a blade of iron fastened into a body of walrus ivory with a
single wooden rivet. While there is no detachable leader, the head is
attached by a separate piece of the same material to the line
(tûkăksia), which is 86 feet 10 inches long and made of a single piece
of fine seal thong about one-eighth inch thick. This shorter piece is
about 27 inches long and is passed through the line hole and doubled so
that one part is a little the longer. It is fastened strongly to the end
of the line by a complicated splice made as follows: A&nbsp;slit is cut
in the end of the main line through which are passed both ends of the
short line. The longer part is then slit about 2 inches from the end and
the shorter part passed through the slit, and a slit cut close to the
end of it, through which the longer end is passed. The whole is then
drawn taut and the longer end clove hitched round the main line.</p>

<p>No. 89908 [1058] is one of these spears rigged ready for darting. The
line is secured at about the middle of the shaft with a couple of
marling hitches. This specimen, except the head, is new and was rather
carelessly made for the market. It has neither line catch nor finger
rest. The
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page233" id = "page233">
233</a></span>
foreshaft and ice pick are lashed in with sinew braid, which is first
knotted round the tip of the shaft and then hitched round with a series
of left-handed soldier’s hitches. The end of the thong which holds the
loose shaft is passed through the hole in it and knotted and the other
end hitched into the pulley at the smallest part of the foreshaft. The
head is like that of the preceding, but has a conoidal body of reindeer
antler, a&nbsp;common material for seal-harpoon heads, and the line,
which is of stout sinew braid 43 feet long, is attached to it simply by
passing the end through the line hole and tying it with a clove hitch to
the standing part 9½ inches from the head. This spear is about the same
size as the preceding. These weapons are all of the same general
pattern, but vary in length according to the height of the owner. The
heads for these harpoons, as well as for the other form of seal harpoon,
are usually about 3 inches long, and, as a rule, have lanceolate blades.
The body is generally conoidal, often made of reindeer antler, and
always, apparently, with a double barb. It is generally plain, but
sometimes ornamented like the walrus-harpoon heads.</p>

<p>No. 89784 [1008] was made by Ilû´bw’ga, the Nunatañmeun, when
thinking of coming to winter at Utkiavwĭñ. He had had no experience in
sealing, having apparently spent all his winters on the rivers inland,
and this harpoon head seems to have been condemned as unsatisfactory by
his new friends at Utkiavwĭñ. It looks like a very tolerable naula, but
is unusually small, being only 2½ inches long.</p>

<p>We saw only one stone blade for a seal harpoon, No. 89623 [1418],
Fig. 226. This is of light olive green jade, and triangular, with
peculiarly dull edges and point. Each face is concaved, and there is a
hole for a rivet. (Compare the jade-bladed harpoon figured by
Nordenskiöld and referred to above.) It is 2 inches long and 0.7 inch
wide at the base. It appears to have been kept as an amulet. The other
form of seal harpoon comes properly under the next head.</p>

<p>For the capture of seals as they come up for air to their breathing
holes or cracks in the ice a harpoon is used which has a short wooden
shaft, armed, as before, with an ice pick and a long, slender, loose
shaft suited for thrusting down through
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page234" id = "page234">
234</a></span>
the small breathing hole. It carries a núalɐ like the other harpoon, but
has only a short line, the end of which is made fast permanently to the
shaft. Such harpoons are used by all Eskimo wherever they are in the
habit of watching for seals at their breathing holes. The slender part
of the shaft, however, is not always loose.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag337" id = "tag337" href = "#note337">337</a> The foreshaft is simply
a stout ferrule for the end of the shaft. These weapons are in general
use at Point Barrow and are very neatly made.</p>

<p>We obtained two specimens, of which No. 89910 [1694], Fig. 227, will
serve as the type. The total length of this spear when rigged for use is
5 feet 3 inches. The shaft is of spruce, 20½ inches long and 1.1 inches
in the middle, tapering to 0.9 at the ends. At the butt is inserted, as
before, an ivory ice pick (túu) of the form already described, 13¾
inches long and lashed in with sinew braid. The foreshaft (kátû) is of
walrus ivory, nearly cylindrical, 5¾ inches long and 0.9 inch in
diameter, shouldered at the butt and fitted into the tip of the shaft
with a round tang. The latter is very neatly whipped with a narrow strip
of white whalebone, which makes eleven turns and has the end of the last
turn forced into a slit in the wood and wedged with a round wooden peg.
Under this whipping is the bill of a tern as a charm for good luck.
(As&nbsp;the boy who pointed this out to me said, “Lots of seals.”)</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 228.&mdash;Diagram of lashing on
shaft.</p>
</div>

<p>The loose shaft (ígimû) is of bone, whale’s rib or jaw, and has two
transverse holes above the shoulder to receive the end of the assembling
line (sábromia), which not only holds the loose shaft in place, but also
connects the other parts of the shaft so that in case the wood breaks
the pieces will not be dropped. It is a long piece of seal thong, of
which one end makes a turn round the loose shaft between the holes; the
other end is passed through the lower hole, then through the upper and
carried down to the tip of the shaft, where it is hitched just below the
whalebone whipping, as follows: three turns are made round the shaft,
the first over the standing part, the second under, and the third over
it; the end then is passed under 3, over 2, and under 1 (Fig. 228), and
all drawn taut; it then runs down the shaft almost to the butt-lashing
and is secured with the same hitch, and the end is whipped around the
butt of the ice pick with five turns. The head (naúlɐ) is of the
ordinary pattern, 2.8 inches long, with a copper blade and antler body.
The line (túkăktĭn) is a single piece of seal thong 9 feet long, and is
fastened to the head without a leader, by simply passing the end through
the line-hole, doubling it over and stopping it to the standing part so
as to make a becket 21 inches long. The other end is made fast round the
shaft and assembling line just back of the middle, as follows: An eye is
made at the end of the line, by cutting a slit close to the tip and
pushing a bight of the line through this. The end then makes a turn
round the shaft, and the other end, with the head, is passed through
this eye and drawn taut. When mounted for use, the head is fitted on the
tip of the loose shaft as usual
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page235" id = "page235">
235</a></span>
and the line brought down to the tip of the shaft and made fast by two
or three round turns with a bight tucked under, so that it can be easily
slipped. It is also confined to the loose shaft by the end of the
assembling line, which makes one or two loose turns round it. The slack
of the line is doubled into “fakes” and tucked between the shaft and
assembling line.</p>

<p>The other specimen is of the same pattern, but slightly different
proportions, having a shaft 18½ inches long and a pick 19 inches long.
The loose shaft is of ivory, and there are lashings of white whalebone
at each end of the shaft. The assembling line is hitched round the
foreshaft as well as round the two ends of the shaft, and simply knotted
round the pick. The line is of very stout sinew braid, and has an eye
neatly spliced in the end for looping it round the shaft. Fig. 229, No.
89551 [1082], is a model of one of these harpoons, made for sale. It is
16¼ inches long, and correct in all its parts, except that the whole
head is of ivory, even to having the ends of the shaft whipped with
light-colored whalebone. The shaft is of pine and the rest of walrus
ivory, with lines of sinew braid. We also collected four loose shafts
for such harpoons. One of these, No. 89489 [802], is of whale’s bone and
unusually short, only 14 inches long. It perhaps belonged to a lad’s
spear. The other three are long, 20 to 25 inches, and are made of
narwhal ivory, as is shown by the spiral twist in the grain.</p>

with floats.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The harpoon used for the whale fishery is a heavy, bulky weapon,
which is never thrown, but thrust with both hands as the whale rises
under the bows of the umiak. When not in use it rests in a large ivory
crotch, shaped like a rowlock, in the bow. The shaft is of wood and 8 or
9 feet long, and there is no loose shaft, the bone or ivory foreshaft
being tapered off to a slender point of such a shape that the head
easily unships. This foreshaft is not weighted, as in the walrus
harpoon, since this is not necessary in a weapon which does not leave
the hand. The harpoon line is fitted with two inflated sealskin
floats.</p>

<p>No complete, genuine whaling harpoons were ever offered for sale, but
a man at Nuwûk made a very excellent reduced model about two-thirds the
usual size (No.&nbsp;89909 [1023], Fig. 230), which will serve as the
type of this weapon
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page236" id = "page236">
236</a></span>
(a´jyûñ). This is 6 feet 11 inches in length when rigged for use. The
shaft is of pine, 5&nbsp;feet 8½ inches long, with its greatest diameter
(1½&nbsp;inches) well forward of the middle and tapered more toward the
butt than toward the tip, which is chamfered off on one side to fit the
butt of the foreshaft (igimû), and shouldered to keep the lashing in
place. The foreshaft is of whale’s bone, 11½ inches long, three-sided
with one edge rounded off, and tapers from a diameter of 1 inch to a
tapering rounded point 1½ inches long, and slightly curved away from the
flat face of the foreshaft. It will easily be seen that the shape of
this tip facilitates the unshipping of the head. The butt is chamfered
off on the flat face to fit the chamfer of the shaft, and the whole
foreshaft is slightly curved in the same direction as the tip. It is
secured to the shaft by a stout whipping of seal thong. The head is 7
inches long, and has a body of walrus ivory, which is ornamented with
incised patterns colored red with ocher, and a blade of dark reddish
brown jasper, neatly flaked. This blade is not unlike a large arrow
head, being triangular, with curved edges, and a short, broad tang
imbedded in the tip of the body, which is seized round with sinew braid.
The body is unusually long and slender and is four sided, with a single
long, sharp barb, keeled on the outer face. The line hole and line
grooves are in the usual position, but the peculiarity of the head is
that the blade is inserted with its breadth in the plane of the body
barb. In other words, this head has not reached the last stage in the
development of the toggle-head. The line is of stout thong (the skin of
the bearded seal) and about 8½ feet long. It is passed
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page237" id = "page237">
237</a></span>
through the line hole, doubled in the middle, the two parts are firmly
stopped together with sinew in four places, and in the ends are cut long
slits for looping on the floats. When the head is fitted on the
foreshaft the line is secured to the flat face of the foreshaft by a
little stop made of a single strand of sinew, easily broken. About 28
inches from the tip of the shaft the line is doubled forward and the
bight stopped to the shaft with six turns of seal thong, so that the
line is held in place and yet can be easily detached by a straight pull.
The ends are then doubled back over the lashing and stopped to the shaft
with a single thread of sinew.</p>

<p>Fig. 231 is a toy model of the whale harpoon, No. 56562 [233], 18½
inches long, made of pine and ivory, and shows the manner of attaching
the floats, which are little blocks of spruce roughly whittled into the
shape of inflated sealskins. A&nbsp;piece of seal thong 13½ inches long
has its ends looped round the neck of the floats and the harpoon-line is
looped into a slit in the middle of this line.</p>

harpoon.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>We collected thirteen heads for such harpoons, which have been in
actual use, of which two have flint blades like the one described, two
have brass blades, and the rest either blades of slate or else no
blades. The flint blades are either triangular like the one described or
lanceolate and are about 3 inches long exclusive of the tang. The three
separate flint blades which we obtained (Fig. 232, No. 56708 [114], from
Utkiavwĭñ, is one of these, made of black flint) are about 1 inch
shorter and were perhaps intended for walrus harpoons, though we saw
none of these with flint blades. They are all newly made for the
market.</p>

<p>The slate blades of which we collected eleven, some old and some new,
besides those in the heads, are all triangular, with curved edges, as in
Fig. 233 (No.&nbsp;56709 [139] from Utkiavwĭñ, made of soft purple
slate), except one new one, No. 56697<i>a</i> [188<i>a</i>], which has
the corners cut off so as to give it a rhomboidal shape. The corners are
sometimes rounded off so that they are nearly heart-shaped. These blades
are usually about 2¾ inches long and 2 broad; two unusually large ones
are 3 inches long and nearly 2¼ broad, and one small one 2.1 by 1.6
inches, and are simply wedged into the blade slit without a rivet. The
brass blades are of the same shape.</p>

<p>The common material for the body seems to have been rather coarse
whale’s bone, from the rib or jaw. Only two out of the thirteen have
ivory bodies, and these are both of the newer brass-bladed pattern. The
body is very long and slender, being usually about 8 or 8½ inches long
(one is 9¼ inches long) and not over 1½ inches broad at the widest part.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page238" id = "page238">
238</a></span>
It is always cut off very obliquely at the base, and the part in front
of the line hole is contracted to a sort of shank, as in Fig. 234
(No.&nbsp;89747 [1044]), a&nbsp;head with slate blade (broken) and bone
body. This represents a very common form in which the shank is
four-sided, while back of the middle the outer face of the barb rises
into a ridge, making this part of the body five-sided. The edges of the
shank are sometimes rounded off so as to make this part elliptical in
section, and all the edges of the body except the keel, on the outer
face of the barb, are frequently rounded off as in Fig. 235<i>a</i>, No.
89745 [1044], which has a slate blade wedged into the bone body with a
bit of old cloth and a wooden wedge. Fig. 235<i>b</i>, No. 56602 [157],
from Utkiavwĭñ, is a head of the same shape, but has a brass blade and a
body of ivory. This blade is wedged in with deer hair, but the other
brass-bladed harpoon, No. 56601 [137], has a single rivet of
whalebone.</p>

<p>The blade slit, and consequently the blade, is always in the plane of
the barb, which position, as I have said before, corresponds to the last
step but one in the development of the harpoon-head. When the blade is
of flint and inserted with a tang, the tip of the body is always whipped
with sinew braid, as in Fig. 212, No. 89748 [928], from Nuwŭk. This
specimen is remarkable as being the only one in the series with a double
point to the barb. These bodies are sometimes ornamented with incised
lines, in conventional patterns, as shown in the different figures.
A&nbsp;short incised mark somewhat resembling an arrow (see above, Fig.
234, No. 89747 [1044]) may have some significance as it is repeated on
several of the heads. Harpoon-heads of this peculiar pattern are to be
found in the Museum collection from other localities. As we should
naturally expect, they have been found at the Diomede Islands, St.
Lawrence Island, and Plover Bay. It is very interesting, however, to
find a specimen of precisely the same type from Greenland, where the
modern harpoons are so different from those used in the west.</p>

<p>That the line connecting the head with the float line is not always
so
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page239" id = "page239">
239</a></span>
long in proportion as represented on the two models is shown by Fig.
236, No. 89744 [969], the only specimen obtained with any part of the
line attached. A&nbsp;piece of stout walrus-hide thong 2 feet long is
passed through the line-hole and doubled in two equal parts, which are
firmly stopped together with sinew about 2 inches from the head. Another
piece of similar thong 4 feet 2 inches long is also doubled into two
equal parts and the ends firmly spliced to those of the short piece
thus: The two ends of the long piece are slit and one end of the short
piece passed through each slit. One of these ends is then slit and
through it are passed the other end of the short piece and the bight of
the long piece, and all is drawn taut and securely seized with sinew.
The becket thus formed was probably looped directly into the bight of
the float line.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 237.&mdash;Foreshaft of whale
harpoon.</p>
</div>

<p>The foreshaft is much larger than that of the model, though of the
same shape. No. 56537 [97], Fig. 237, from Utkiavwĭñ, is of walrus-ivory
and 15.8 inches long with a diameter of 1½ inches at the butt. The
oblong slot at the beginning of the chamfer is to receive the end of the
lashing which secured this to the shaft. This form of foreshaft is very
well adapted to insure the unshipping of the toggle-head, but lacks the
special advantage of the loose-shaft, namely, that under a violent
lateral strain it unships without breaking. The question at once
suggests itself, why was not the improvement that is used on all the
other harpoons applied to this one? In my opinion, the reason for this
is the same as for retaining the form of toggle-head, which, as I have
shown, is of an ancient pattern.</p>

<p>That is to say, the modern whale harpoon is the same pattern that was
once used for all harpoons, preserved for superstitious reasons. It is a
well known fact, that among many peoples implements, ideas, and language
have been preserved in connection with religious
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page240" id = "page240">
240</a></span>
ceremonies long after they have gone out of use in every-day life. Now,
the whale fishing at Port Barrow, in many respects the most important
undertaking in the life of the natives, is so surrounded by
superstitious observances, ceremonies to be performed, and other things
of the same nature as really to assume a distinctly religious character.
Hence, we should naturally expect to find the implements used in it more
or less archaic in form. That this is the case in regard to the
toggle-head I think I have already shown. It seems to me equally evident
that this foreshaft, which contains the loose shaft and foreshaft,
undifferentiated, is also the older form.</p>

<p>Why the development of the harpoon was arrested at this particular
stage is not so easily determined. A&nbsp;natural supposition would be
that this was the form of harpoon used by their ancestors when they
first began to be successful whalemen.</p>

<p>That they connect the idea of good luck with these ancient stone
harpoons is shown by what occurred at Point Barrow in 1883. Of late
years they have obtained from the ships many ordinary “whale-irons,” and
some people at least had got into the habit of using them.</p>

<p>Now, the bad luck of the season of 1882, when the boats of both
villages together caught only one small whale, was attributed to the use
of these “irons,” and it was decided by the elders that the <i>first</i>
harpoon struck into the whale must be a stone-bladed one such as their
forefathers used when they killed many whales.</p>

<p>In this connection, it is interesting to note a parallel custom
observed at Point Hope. Hooper<a class = "tag" name = "tag338" id =
"tag338" href = "#note338">338</a> says that at this place the beluga
must always be struck with a <i>flint</i> spear, even if it has been

<p>As I have said on a preceding page, some of the natives now use
bomb-guns for dispatching the harpooned whale, and all the whaleboats
are provided with steel whale lances obtained from the ships. In former
times they used a large and powerful lance with a broad flint head. They
seem to have continued the use of this weapon, probably for the same
reasons that led them to retain the ancient harpoon for whaling until
they obtained their present supply of steel lances, as we found no signs
of iron whale lances of native manufacture, such as are found in
Greenland and elsewhere. We obtained nine heads for stone lances
(kaluwiɐ) and one complete lance, a&nbsp;very fine specimen
(No.&nbsp;56765 [537], Fig. 238), which was brought down as a present
from Nuwŭk. The broad, sharp head is of light gray flint, mounted on a
shaft of spruce 12 feet 6 inches long. It has a broad, stout tang
inserted in the cleft end of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page241" id = "page241">
241</a></span>
shaft. The shaft is rhomboidal in section with rounded edges, and tapers
from a breadth of 2 inches and a thickness of 1 at the tip to a butt of
0.7 inch broad and 1 thick. The tip of the shaft has a whipping of
sinew-braid 1¾ inches deep, “kackled” down on both edges, one end of the
twine on each edge, so that the hitch made by one end crosses the round
turn of the other, making in all twenty-six turns. The shaft has been
painted red for 1½ inches below the whipping.</p>

<p>No. 89596 [1032] is the head and 5 inches of the shaft of a similar
lance. The head is of black flint, and the sinew-braid forms a simple
whipping. The remaining heads are all unmounted. I&nbsp;have figured
several of them to show the variations of this now obsolete weapon. Fig.
239, No. 56677 [49], from Utkiavwĭñ, is of gray flint chipped in large
flakes. The total length is 6.9 inches. The small lugs on the edges of
the tang are to keep it from slipping out of the whipping. No. 56679
[239], also from Utkiavwĭñ, is of black flint and broader than the
preceding. Its length is 6.3 inches. No. 56680 [394], from the same
village, is of light bluish gray flint and very broad. It is 5.4 inches
long. No. 56681 [5], from Utkiavwĭñ, is another broad
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page242" id = "page242">
242</a></span>
head of black flint, 6&nbsp;inches long. Fig. 240<i>a</i>, No. 89597
[1034], from Nuwŭk, is of black flint, and unusually long in proportion,
running into the tang with less shoulder than usual. Much of the
original surface is left untouched on one face. This is probably very
old. No. 89598 [1361] is a head of similar shape of dark gray flint from
Sidaru. It is 6 inches long. Fig. 240<i>b</i>, No. 89599 [1373], from
the same place and of similar material, is shaped very like the head of
a steel lance. It is 5 inches long. Fig. 240<i>c</i>, No. 89600 [1069],
from Utkiavwĭñ, is still broader in proportion and almost heart-shaped.
It is of bluish gray flint and 4.8 inches long. These heads probably
represent most of the different forms in use. Only two types are to be
recognized among them, the long-pointed oval with a short tang, and the
broad leaf-shaped head with a rather long tang, which appears to be the
commoner form.</p>

lance.</p>
</div>

<p>We obtained one newly made lance of a pattern similar to the above,
but smaller, which was said to be a model of the weapon used in
attacking the polar bear before the introduction of firearms. The name,
pû´nnû, is curiously like the name panna given by Dr. Simpson and Capt.
Parry to the large double-edged knife. The specimen, No. 89895 [1230],
Fig. 241, came from Utkiavwĭñ. It has a head of gray flint 3½ inches
long, exclusive of the tang, roughly convex on one face, but flat and
merely beveled at the edges on the other. The edges are finely serrate.
The shaft is of spruce, 6&nbsp;feet 8 inches long, rounded and somewhat
flattened at the tip, which is 1 inch wide and tapering to a diameter of
0.7 at the butt, and is painted red with ocher. The tip has a slight
shoulder to keep the whipping in place. The tang is wedged in with bits
of leather and secured by a close whipping of sinew braid 1¼ inches
deep. Fig. 242, No. 89611 [1034], from Nuwŭk, was probably the head of
such a lance, although it is somewhat narrower and slightly shorter. Its
total length is 3.4 inches. The other two large lance-heads, No.
56708<i>a</i> [114<i>a</i>] and No. 56708<i>b</i> [114<i>b</i>], are
both new, but were probably meant for the bear lance. They are of gray
flint, 3½ inches long, and have the edges regularly serrate.</p>

<p>One form of lance is still in general use. It has a sharp metal head,
and a light wooden shaft about 6 feet long. It is used in the kaiak for
stabbing deer swimming in the water, after the manner frequently noticed
among other Eskimo.<a class = "tag" name = "tag339" id = "tag339" href =
"#note339">339</a> A&nbsp;pair of these spears is carried in beckets on
the forward deck of the kaiak. On approaching a deer one of them is
slipped out of the becket and laid on the deck, with the butt resting on
the combing of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page243" id = "page243">

the cockpit. The hunter then paddles rapidly up alongside of the deer,
grasps the lance near the butt, as he would a dagger, and stabs the
animal with a quick downward thrust. This spear is called kă´pun, which
in the Point Barrow dialect exactly corresponds to the Greenlandic word
kapût, which is applied to the long-bladed spear or long knife used for
dispatching a harpooned seal.<a class = "tag" name = "tag340" id =

<p>No. 73183 [524], Figs. 243<i>a</i>, 243<i>b</i> (head enlarged), will
serve as a type of this weapon, of which we have two specimens. All that
we saw were essentially like this. The head is iron, 4¾ inches long
exclusive of the tang, and 1½ inches broad. The edges are narrowly
beveled on both faces. The shaft is 6 feet 2 inches long, and tapers
from a diameter of 0.8 inch about the middle to about one-half inch at
each end. The tip is cleft to receive the tang of the head, and
shouldered to keep the whipping from slipping off. The latter was of
sinew braid and 2 inches deep. The shaft is painted with red ocher. The
other has a shaft 6 feet 4 inches long, but otherwise resembles the
preceding. The heads for these lances are not always made of iron.
Copper, brass, etc., are sometimes used. No. 56699 [166] is one of a
pair of neatly made copper lance heads. It is 5.9 inches long and 1½
wide, and ground down on each face to a sharp edge without a bevel,
except just at the point. Before the introduction of iron these lances
had stone heads, but were otherwise of the same shape. Fig. 244
represents the head and 6 inches of the shaft of one of these
(No.&nbsp;89900 [1157] from Nuwŭk). The shaft is new and rather
carelessly made of a rough, knotty piece of spruce, and is 5 feet 5¾
inches long. The head is of black flint and 2 inches long, exclusive of
the tang, and the tip of the shaft is whipped with a narrow strip of
light-colored whalebone, the end of which is secured by passing it
through a slit in the side of the shaft and wedging it into a crack on
the opposite side. This is an old head newly mounted for the market, and
the head is wedged in with a bit of blue flannel.</p>

<p>No. 89897 [1324], Fig. 245, from Utkiavwĭñ, on the other hand, is an
old shaft 5 feet 7½ inches long, fitted with a new head, which is very
broad, and shaped like the head of a bear lance. It is of variegated
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page244" id = "page244">
244</a></span>
jasper, brown and gray, and has a piece of white sealskin lapped over
the cleft of the shaft at each side of the tang so that the edges of the
two pieces almost meet in the middle. They are secured by a spaced
whipping of sinew braid. This shaft, which is painted red, evidently had
a broad head formerly, as it is expanded at the tip. No. 89896 [1324] is
the mate to this, evidently made to match it. We also obtained one other
flint-headed lance. The mate to No. 89900 [1157], No. 89898 [1157], has
a head of dark gray slate 2.3 inches long. This spear appears to be
wholly old, except the whipping of sinew braid. The shaft is of spruce,
5&nbsp;feet 4¾ inches long, and painted red with ocher. We also
collected three stone heads for such lances. Fig. 246, No. 38711 [148],
from Utkiavwĭñ, shows the shape of the tang. It is of gray flint, and
3.7 inches long. No. 89610 [1154] is a beautiful lance head of polished
olive green jade, 4.3 inches long. The hole in the tang is probably not
intended for a rivet, as none of the lance heads which we saw were
fastened in this way. It is more likely that it was perforated for
attaching it to the belt as an amulet. We were told that this lance head
was brought from the west. A&nbsp;large slate lance head found by
Nordenskiöld<a class = "tag" name = "tag341" id = "tag341" href =

precisely the same shape as these deer-lance heads, but from its size
was probably intended for a whale lance.</p>

for carrying.</p>
</div>

<p>The only throwing weapon which these people use is a small bolas,
designed for catching birds on the wing. This consists of six or seven
small ivory balls, each attached to a string about 30 inches long, the
ends of which are fastened together to a tuft of feathers, which serves
as a handle and perhaps directs the flight of the missile. When not in
use the strings are shortened up, as in Fig. 247, No. 75969 [1793], for
convenience in carrying and to keep them from tangling, by tying them
into slip knots, as follows: All the strings being straightened out and
laid parallel to each other, they are doubled in a bight, with the end
under the standing part, the bight of the end passed through the
preceding bight, which is drawn up close, and so on, usually five or six
times, till the strings are sufficiently shortened. A&nbsp;pull on the
two ends slips all these knots and the strings come out straight and
untangled.</p>

<p>The bolas is carried knotted up in a pouch slung round the neck,
a&nbsp;native frequently carrying several sets. When a flock of ducks is
seen approaching, the handle is grasped in the right
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page245" id = "page245">
245</a></span>
hand, the balls in the left, and the strings are straightened out with a
quick pull. Letting go with the left hand the balls are whirled round
the head and let fly at the passing flock. The balls spread apart in
flying through the air, so as to cover considerable space, like a charge
of shot, and if they are stopped by striking a duck, the strings
immediately wrap around him and hamper his flight so that he comes to
the ground. The natives said that the balls flew with sufficient force
to stun a duck or break his wing, but we never happened to see any taken
except in the way just described. A&nbsp;duck is occasionally left with
sufficient freedom of motion to escape with the bolas hanging to him.
The weapon is effective up to 30 or 40 yards, but the natives often
throw it to a longer distance, frequently missing their aim. It is
universally employed, especially by those who have no guns, and a good
many ducks are captured with it. In the spring, when the ducks are
flying, the women and children hardly ever stir out of the house without
one or more of these.</p>

<p>We brought home one specimen of this implement (kelauĭtau´tĭn), No.
75969 [1793], Fig. 248, which is new and has the balls rather carelessly
made. The balls, which are six in number, are of walrus ivory, 1.6 to
1.8 inches long and 1 inch in diameter (except one which is flattened,
2&nbsp;inches long and 1.3 wide; they are usually all of the same
shape). Through the larger end is drilled a small hole, the ends of
which are joined by a shallow groove running over the end, into which
the ends of the strings are fastened by three half-hitches each. There
is one string of sinew braid to each set of two balls, doubled in the
middle so that all six parts are equal and about 28 inches long. They
are fastened to the feather handle as follows: Nine wing feathers of the
eider duck are laid side by side, butt to point, and doubled in the
middle so that the quills and vanes stand up on all sides. The middle of
each string is laid across the bight of the feathers, so that the six
parts come out on all sides between the feathers. The latter are then
lashed tightly together with a bit of sinew braid, by passing the end
over the bend of the feathers and tying with the rest of the string
round the feathers.</p>

<p>These weapons are generally very much like the specimen described,
but vary somewhat in the shape and material of the balls, which are
sometimes simply ovoid or spherical, and often made of single teeth of
the walrus, instead of tusk ivory. Bone is also sometimes used. In
former times, the astragalus bones of the reindeer, perforated through
the ridge on one end were used for balls. No. 89490 [1342], is a pair of
such bones tied together with a bit of thong, which appear to have been
actually used. No. 89537 [1251] from Utkiavwĭñ is a very old ball, which
is small (1.1 inches long) and unusually flat. It appears to have been
kept as a relic.</p>

<p>There is very little information to be found concerning the extent of
the region in which this implement is used, either in the Museum
collections or in the writings of authors. A&nbsp;few points, however,
have been made out with certainty. The bolas are unknown among all the
Eskimo east of the Anderson River, and the only evidence that we have of
their use at this point is an entry in the Museum catalogue, to which I
have been unable to find a corresponding specimen. Dease and Simpson, in
1837, did not observe them till they reached Point Barrow.<a class =

<p>I have already spoken of the floats (apotû´kpûñ) of inflated sealskin
used in capturing the whale and walrus. We obtained one specimen, No.
73578 [538] Fig. 249. This is the whole skin, except the head, of a male
rough seal (Phoca fœtida), with the hair out. The carcass was carefully
removed without making any incision except round the neck and a few
inches down the throat, and skinned to the very

toes, leaving the claws on. All natural or accidental apertures are
carefully sewed up, except the genital opening, into which is inserted a
ring of ivory, which serves as a mouthpiece for inflating the skin and
is corked with a plug of wood. The cut in the throat is carefully sewed
up, and the neck puckered together, and wrapped with seal thong into a
slender shank about 1 inch long, leaving a flap of skin which is wrapped
round a rod of bone 4 inches long and 1 in diameter, set across the
shank, and wound with thong. This makes a handle for looping on the
harpoon line.</p>

<p>All the floats used at Point Barrow are of the same general pattern

skins of the harbor seal (P.&nbsp;vitulina) are sometimes used. One of
these floats is attached to the walrus harpoon, but two are used in
whaling.<a class = "tag" name = "tag346" id = "tag346" href =

They are employed by all Eskimo who pursue the larger marine
mammals.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "hunting_toggles" id = "hunting_toggles"
href = "#hunting">Flipper toggles.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>We collected two pairs of peculiar implements, in the shape of ivory
whales about 5 inches long, with a perforation in the belly through
which a large thong could be attached. We understood that they were to
be fastened to the ends of a stout thong and used when a whale was
killed to toggle his flippers together so as to keep them in place while
towing him to the ice, by cutting holes in the flippers and passing the
ivory through. We unfortunately never had an opportunity of verifying
this story. Neither pair is new. Fig. 250<i>a</i> represents a pair of
these implements (kă´gotĭñ) (No.&nbsp;56580 [227]). They are of white
walrus ivory. In the middle of each belly is excavated a deep, oblong
cavity about three-fourths of an inch long and one-half wide, across the
middle of which is a stout transverse bar for the attachment of the
line. One is a “bow-head” whale (Balæna mysticetus), 4½ inches long, and
the other evidently intended for a “California gray” (Rhachinectes
glaucus). It has light blue glass beads inserted for eyes and is the
same length as the other.</p>

<p>Fig. 250 (No. 56598 [407]) is a similar pair, which are both
“bowheads” nearly 5 inches long. Both have cylindrical plugs of ivory
inserted for eyes, and are made of a piece of ivory so old that the
surface is a light chocolate color. The name, kăgotĭñ, means literally
“a&nbsp;pair of toggles.”</p>

<p>Fig. 251<i>a</i> represents one of these boxes (No. 56505 [138])
intended for spare blades for the whale harpoon. This is rather neatly
carved from a single block of soft wood, apparently spruce, though it is
very old and much weathered, in the shape of a “bowhead” whale, 9½
inches long. The ends of the flukes are broken short off, and show
traces of having been mended with wooden pegs or dowels. The right eye
is indicated by a simple incision, but a tiny bit of crystal is inlaid
for the left. Two little bits of crystal are also inlaid in the middle
of the back. The belly is flat and excavated into a deep triangular
cavity, with its base just forward of the angle of the mouth and the
apex at the “small.” It is beveled round the edge, with a shoulder at
the base and apex, and is covered with a flat triangular piece of wood
beveled on the under face to fit the edge of the cavity. About half of
one side of the cover has been split off and mended on with two
“stitches” of whalebone fiber. The cover is held on by three strings of
seal thong passing through holes in each corner of the cover and secured
by a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page249" id = "page249">

knot in the end of each string. They then pass through three
corresponding holes in the bottom of the cavity, leaving outside of the
back two ends 7 inches and one 15 long, which are tied together. The
cover can be lifted wholly off and then drawn back into its place by
pulling the string.</p>

<p>We collected seven such whale-harpoon boxes, usually about 9 to 9¾

for the eyes and in the middle of the back, and the cover is generally
rigged in the way described. No. 56502 [198], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page250" id = "page250">

large whale, a&nbsp;foot long, and has the tail bent up, while the
animal is usually represented as if lying still. It has good-sized
sky-blue beads inlaid for the eyes.</p>

<p>Fig. 251<i>b</i> (No. 89733 [1161], from Nuwŭk) represents a small
box 4⅓ inches long, probably older than the others, and the only one not
carved into the shape of a whale. It is roughly egg-shaped and has no
wooden cover to the cavity, which is covered with a piece of deerskin,
held on by a string of seal thong wrapped three times around the body in
a rough, deep groove, with the end tucked under. In this box are five
slate blades for the whale harpoon.</p>

<p>We also collected two boxes for walrus harpoons made in the shape of
the walrus, with ivory or bone tusks. No. 89732 [860], Fig. 251<i>c</i>,
from Nuwŭk, is old, and 7 inches long, and has two oval bits of ivory,
with holes bored to represent the pupils, inlaid for the eyes. There is
no cover, but the cavity is filled with a number of slate blades,
carefully packed in whalebone shavings. There is a little eyebolt of
ivory at each end of the cavity. One end of a bit of sinew braid is tied
to the anterior of these, and the other carried down through the hinder
one, and then brought up and fastened round the body with a marling
hitch. The <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘other(No.’">other, No.</ins>&nbsp;56489 [127], is new and rather roughly
made, 5&nbsp;inches long and painted all over with red ocher. It has a
cover, but no strings.</p>

<p>No. 56501 [142], Fig. 251<i>d</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ, is for carrying
harpoon blades for the chase of the bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus),
and is neatly carved into the shape of that animal. It is 7.4 inches
long and has ivory eyes like the walrus box, No. 89732 [860]. The cover
is fitted to the cavity like those of the whale boxes, but is held on by
one string only, a&nbsp;piece of seal thong about 3 feet long passing
through the middle of the cover and out at a hole on the left side,
about one-fourth inch from the cavity. The box is filled with raveled
rope-yarns. Fig. 251<i>e</i> (No.&nbsp;89730 [981], from Utkiavwĭñ) is
like this, but very large, 9.3 inches long. The cover is thick and a
little larger than the cavity, beveled on the upper face and notched on
each side to receive the string, which is a bit of sinew braid fastened
to two little ivory hooks, one on each side of the body. It is fastened
to the right hook, carried across and hooked around the left-hand one,
then carried over and hooked round the other, and secured by tucking a
bight of the end under the last part. The box contains several slate
blades. We also collected one other large seal box (No.&nbsp;89731
[859], from Nuwŭk), very roughly carved, and 9.8 inches long. The cover
is fitted into the cavity and held on by a narrow strip of whalebone
running across in a transverse groove in the cover and through a hole in
each side of the box.</p>

<p>The smaller seals are captured in large-meshed nets of rawhide. We
brought home one of these, No. 56756 [109], Figs 252<i>a</i>-252<i>b</i>
(detail of mesh). This is a rectangular net, eighteen meshes long and
twelve deep, netted of fine seal thong with the ordinary netting knot.
The length of the mesh is 14 inches.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 252.&mdash;Seal net.</p>

<p>Such nets are set under the ice in winter, or in shoal water along
the shore by means of stakes in summer. In the ordinary method of
setting the net under the ice two small holes are cut through the ice
the length of the net apart, and between them in the same straight line
is cut a third large enough to permit a seal to be drawn up through it.
A&nbsp;line with a plummet on the end is let down through one of the
small holes, and is hooked through the middle hole, with a long slender
pole of willow, often made of several pieces spliced together, with a
small wooden hook on the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page252" id = "page252">
252</a></span>
end. The line is then detached from the plummet and fastened to one
upper corner of the net, and a second line is let down through the other
small hole and made fast in the same way to the other upper corner. By
pulling on these lines the net is drawn down through the middle and
stretched like a curtain under the ice, while a line at the middle
serves to haul it up again. The end lines are but loosely made fast to
lumps of ice, so that when a seal strikes the net nothing hinders his
wrapping it completely around him in his struggles to escape. When the
hunter, who is usually watching his net, thinks the seal is sufficiently
entangled he hauls him up through the large hole and sets the net
again.</p>

<p>I had no opportunity of observing whether any weights or plummets
were used to keep down the lower edge of the net. These nets are now
universally employed, but one native spoke of a time “long ago” when
there were no nets and they captured seals with the spear (u´nɐ) alone.
The net was used in seal catching in Dr. Simpson’s time, though he makes
but a casual reference to it,<a class = "tag" name = "tag347" id =

holes in the ice. “Ice nets” are spoken of as in use for sealing in
Greenland, but I have been able to find no description of them. As they
are not spoken of by either Egede or Crantz I am inclined to believe
that they were introduced by the Europeans.<a class = "tag" name =

Hudson Strait, where they use a very long net set under the ice very
much as at Point Barrow. I&nbsp;can find no mention of the use of seal
nets among any other of the eastern Eskimo.</p>

<p>It is well known that seals have a great deal of curiosity, and are
easily attracted by any unusual sounds, especially if they are gentle
and long-continued. It is therefore easy to entice them into the nets by
making such noises, for instance, gentle whistling, rattling on the ice
with the pick, and so forth. Two special implements are also used for
this purpose. The first kind I have called:</p>

<p>This implement consists of three or four claws mounted on the end of
a short wooden handle, and is used to make a gentle noise by scratching
on the ice. It is a common implement, though I never happened to see it
in use. We obtained six specimens, of which No. 56555 [90] Fig.
253<i>a</i>, is the type. It is 11½ inches long. The round handle is of
ash, the claws are those of the bearded seal, secured by a lashing of
sinew braid, with the end brought down on the under side to a little
blunt, backward-pointing hook of ivory, set into the wood about 1 inch
from the base of the arms.</p>

<p>Fig. 253<i>b</i> (No. 56557 [93] from Utkiavwĭñ is 9½ inches long and
has four prongs. The haft is of spruce, and instead of an ivory hook
there is a round-headed stud of the same material, which is driven
wholly through the wood, having the point cut off flush with the upper
surface. It has a lanyard of seal twine knotted into the hole in the
haft. The other two specimens of this pattern, Nos. 56556 [100] and
56558 [51] have each three claws, and hafts of soft wood, painted with
red ocher, with lanyards, and are respectively 10.4 and 10.7 inches
long. One has an ivory hook, but the other in place of this has a small
iron nail, and is ornamented with a medium-sized sky-blue glass bead
inlaid in the back. The other two are both new and small, being
respectively 7.5 and 7.6 inches long. The hafts are made of reindeer
antler and have only two prongs. No. 89467 [1312] from Utkiavwĭñ, has
the haft notched on each side, and has an irregular stud of bone for
securing the lashing.</p>

of these were made for the market, but may be models of a form once

speaks of the use of this implement at Pitlekaj and figures a
specimen.<a class = "tag" name = "tag353" id = "tag353" href =

<p>We obtained only two specimens, No. 56533 [409], which seem to be a
pair. Fig. 254 is one of these. It is of cottonwood and 4 inches long,
roughly carved into the shape of a seal’s head and painted red, with two
small transparent blue glass beads inlaid for the eyes. The neat becket
of seal thong consists of three or four turns with the end wrapped
spirally around them. The staple on which the ivory pendants hang is of
iron. This is believed to be a rattle to be shaken on the ice by a
string tied to the becket for the purpose of attracting seals to the ice
net. It was brought in for sale at a time during our first year when we
were very busy with zoological work, and as something was said about
“nĕtyĭ” and “kubra” (“seal” and “net”) the collector concluded that they
must be floats for seal nets, and they were accordingly catalogued as
such and laid away. We never happened to see another specimen, and as
these were sent home in 1882 we learned no more of their history. The
late Dr. Emil Bessels, however, on my return called my attention to the
fact that in the museum at Copenhagen there is a single specimen very
similar to these, which was said to have been used in the manner
described above. It came from somewhere in eastern America. There is
one, he told me, in the British Museum from Bering Strait. The National
Museum contains several specimens collected by Mr. Nelson at Point Hope.
It is very probable that this is the correct explanation of the use of
these objects, as it assigns a function to the ivory pendants which
would otherwise be useless. They have been called “dog bells,” but the
Eskimo, at Point Barrow, at least, are not in the habit of marking their
dogs in any way.</p>

<p>When watching for a seal at his breathing hole a native inserts in
the hole a slender rod of ivory, which is held loosely in place by a
cross piece or a bunch of feathers on the end. When the seal rises he
pushes up this rod, which is so light that he does not notice it, and
thus warns the hunter when to shoot or strike with his spear. Most of
the seal hunting was done at such a distance from the station that I
remember only one occasion when this implement was
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page255" id = "page255">
255</a></span>
seen in use. We collected two specimens, of which No. 56507 [104], Fig.
255<i>a</i>, will serve as the type. It is of walrus ivory, 14½ inches
long and 0.3 in diameter, with a small lanyard of sinew. The curved
cross piece of ivory, 1⅓ inches long, is inserted into a slot one-fourth
of an inch from the end and secured by a little treenail of wood.</p>

<p>Fig. 255<i>b</i> (No. 89454 [1114], from Nuwŭk) is a similar
indicator, 13½ inches long and flat (0.3 inch wide and 0.1 thick). The
upper end is carved into scallops for ornament and has a small eye into
which was knotted a bit of whalebone fiber. The tip is beveled off with
a concave bevel on both faces to a sharp edge, so that it can be used
for a “feather setter” (ĭgugwau) in feathering arrows. Such implements
are mentioned in most popular accounts of the Eskimo of the east, and
Capt. Parry describes it from personal observation at Iglulik.<a class =

<p>When a native is watching a seal-hole he frequently has to stand for
hours motionless on the ice. His feet would become exceedingly cold, in
spite of the excellence of his foot covering, were it not for a little
three-legged stool about 10 inches high upon which he stands. This stool
is made of wood, with a triangular top just large enough to accommodate
a man’s feet, with the heels together over one leg of the stool, and the
other two legs supporting the toes of each foot, respectively. The stool
is neatly made, and is as light as is consistent with strength. It is
universally employed and carried by the hunter, slung on the gun cover
with the legs projecting behind.</p>

<p>When the hunter has a long time to wait he generally squats down so
as almost to sit on his heels, holding his gun and spear in readiness,
and wholly covered with one of the deerskin cloaks already described.
They sometimes use this stool to sit on when waiting for ducks to fly
over the ice in the spring.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page256" id = "page256">
256</a></span>
<p>We brought home two specimens of this common object (nĭgawaúotĭn).
No. 89887 [1411], Fig. 250, will serve as the type. The top is of
spruce, 8¾ inches long and 10¾ wide. The upper surface is flat and
smooth, the lower broadly beveled off on the edges and deeply excavated
in the middle, so that there are three straight ridges joining the three
legs, each of which stands in the middle of a slight prominence. The
object of cutting away the wood in this way is to make the stool
lighter, leaving it thick only at the points where the pressure comes.
The large round hole in the middle, near the front, is for convenience
in picking it up and hanging it on the cache frame, where it is
generally kept. The three legs are set into holes at each corner,
spreading out so as to stand on a base larger than the top of the stool.
Where they fit into the holes they are 0.7 inch in diameter, tapered
slightly to fit the hole, and then tapering down to a diameter of
one-third inch at the tip. On the under side of the top they are braced
with a lashing of stout seal thong. A&nbsp;split on the right-hand edge
of the top has been mended, as usual, with a stitch of whalebone. This
stool is quite old and has been actually used.</p>

<p>No. 89888 [1412], from the same village, is new and a little larger,
but differs from the type only in having a triangular instead of a round
hole in the top and no lashing. Those of our party who landed at Sidaru
September 7, 1881, saw one of these stools hanging up in the then vacant
village, and there is a precisely similar stool in the Museum from the
Anderson region.</p>

<p>MacFarlane, in his manuscript notes, describes the use of these
stools as follows: “Both tribes kill seals under ice; that is, they
watch for them at their holes (breathing) or wherever open water
appears. At the former they generally build a small snow house somewhat
like a sentinel’s box, on the bottom of which they fix a portable
three-cornered stool, made of wood. They stand on this and thereby
escape getting cold feet, as would be the case were they to remain for
any time on ice or snow in the same immovable position.” Beyond this I
find no mention of the use of any such a utensil, east or west, except
in Greenland, where, however, they used a sort of one-legged chair to
sit on, as well as a footstool, which Egede pictures (Pl.&nbsp;9) as
oval, with very short legs.<a class = "tag" name = "tag355" id =

<p>Every seal hunter carries with him a line for dragging home his game,
consisting of a stout thong doubled in a bight about 18 inches long,
with an ivory handle or knob at the other end. The bight is looped into
an incision in the seal’s lower jaw, while the knob serves for attaching
a longer line or the end of a dog’s harness. The seal is dragged on his
back and runs as smoothly as a sled. We
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page257" id = "page257">
257</a></span>
collected eight of these drag lines, from which I have selected No.
56624 [44], Fig. 257<i>a</i>, as the type.</p>

<p class = "illustration"><a name = "fig257" id = "fig257"></a>

alt = "see caption"></p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 257.&mdash;Seal drags and
handles.</p>

<p>This consists of a stout thong of rawhide (the skin of the bearded
seal) 0.3 inch wide and 37 inches long, and doubled in a bight so that
one end is about 2½ inches the longer. These ends are fastened into a
handle of walrus ivory, consisting of three pieces, namely: a&nbsp;pair
of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page258" id = "page258">
258</a></span>
neatly carved mittens, respectively 1.9 and 1.8 inches long, put
together wrist to wrist with the palms up; and lying across the joint
above, a&nbsp;little seal 1¼ inches long, belly down. A&nbsp;hole runs
through each wrist and through the belly of the seal. The mittens are
ornamented on the back with a blackened incised pattern, and the seal
has blue glass beads for eyes and blackened incised spots on the back.
The longer end of the thong runs up through the right mitten, across
through the seal, and down through the left mitten. It is then passed
through a slit 1 inch from the end of the shorter part and slit itself.
Through this slit is passed the bight of the thong, all drawn up taut
and seized with sinew braid.</p>

<p>No. 89467 [755], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar drag, put together in
much the same way, but it has the mittens doweled together with two
wooden pins, and a seal’s head with round bits of wood inlaid for eyes,
ears, and nostrils, in place of the seal. The longitudinal perforation
in this head shows that it was originally strung lengthwise on one of
these lines. The “double slit splice” of the two ends of the thong is
worked into a complicated round knot, between which and the handle the
two parts of the line are confined by a tube of ivory 1 inch long,
ornamented with deeply incised patterns. Fig. 257<i>b</i> is the upper
part of a line (No.&nbsp;56622 [36], from Utkiavwĭñ), with a similar
tube 1¾ inches long, and a handle carved from a single piece into a pair
of mittens like the others.</p>

<p>No. 56625 [81], also from Utkiavwĭñ, is almost exactly similar to the
one first described, but has the seal belly up. Fig. 257<i>c</i>
(No.&nbsp;89470 [1337], from the same village) has a seal 2.3 inches
long for the handle, and No. 56626 [212], from Utkiavwĭñ, is like it.
No. 89469<i>a</i>, [755<i>a</i>] Fig. 257<i>d</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ, has
for a handle the head of a bearded seal 1.6 inches long, neatly carved
from walrus ivory, with round bits of wood inlaid for the eyes and ears.
It is perforated longitudinally from the chin to the back of the head,
and a large hole at the throat opens into this. The longer end of the
thong is passed in at the chin and out at the back of the head; the
shorter, in at the back of the head and out at the throat; the two ends
brought together between the standing parts and all stopped together
with sinew braid.</p>

<p>No. 56627 [45], Fig. 257<i>e</i>, has a handle made of two ivory
bears’ heads, very neatly carved, with circular bits of wood inlaid for
eyes, and perforated like the seal’s head just described. The thong is
doubled in the middle and each end passed through one of the heads
lengthwise, so as to protrude about 7 inches. About 4 inches of end is
then doubled over, thrust through the throat hole of the opposite head,
and brought down along the standing parts. All the parts are stopped
together with sinew braid. This makes a small becket above the
handle.</p>

<p>We collected seven knobs for these drag lines, of which six are
seals’ heads and one a bear’s. They are all made of walrus ivory,
apparently each a single tooth, and not a piece of tusk, and are about
1½ inches to 2 inches long. They are generally carved with considerable
skill, and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page259" id = "page259">
259</a></span>
often have the ears, roots of the whiskers, nostrils, and outline of the
mouth incised and blackened, while small blue beads, bits of ivory, or
wood are inlaid for the eyes. Implements of this sort are in common use
among Eskimo generally wherever they are so situated as to be able to
engage in seal-hunting. Mr. Nelson’s collection contains specimens from
as far south as Cape Darby.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of the steel traps, which they now obtain by
trade, these people used a peculiar contrivance for catching the wolf.
This consists of a stout rod of whalebone about 1 foot long and one-half
inch broad, with a sharp point at each end. One of these was folded
lengthwise in the form of a Z,<a class = "tag" name = "tag356" id =
"tag356" href = "#note356">356</a> wrapped in blubber (whale’s blubber
was used, according to our informant, Nĭkawáalu), and frozen solid. It
was then thrown out on the snow where the wolf could find and swallow
it. The heat of the animal’s body would thaw out the blubber, releasing
the whalebone, which would straighten out and pierce the walls of the
stomach, thus causing the animal’s death. Nikawáalu says that a wolf
would not go far after swallowing one of these blubber balls.</p>

<p>We collected four sets of these contrivances, one set containing
seven rods and the others four each. Fig. 258<i>a</i> gives a good idea
of the shape of one of these. It belongs to a set of seven, No. 89538
[1229], Fig. 258<i>b</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ, which are old and show the
marks of having been doubled up. It is 12½ inches long, 0.4 broad, and
0.2 thick. The little notches on the opposite edges of each end were
probably to hold a lashing of sinew which kept the folded rod in shape
while the blubber was freezing, being cut by thrusting a knife through
the partially frozen blubber, as is stated by Schwatka.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag357" id = "tag357" href = "#note357">357</a> Two of the sets
are new, but made like the others.</p>

<p>This contrivance is also used by the Eskimo of Hudson Bay<a class =
"tag" name = "tag358" id = "tag358" href = "#note358">358</a> and at
Norton Sound, where, according to Petroff,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag359" id = "tag359" href = "#note359">359</a> the rods are 2 feet
long and wrapped in seal blubber. The name ĭsĭ´bru appears to be the
same as the Greenlandic (isavssok), found only in the diminutive
isavssoraĸ, a&nbsp;provincial name for the somewhat similar
sharp-pointed stick baited with blubber and used for catching gulls. The
diminutive form of this
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page260" id = "page260">
260</a></span>
word in Greenlandic may indicate that their ancestors once used the
large wolf-killer, when they lived where wolves were found. The
definition of uju´kuaĸ, the ordinary word for the gull-catcher (see
below)&mdash;in the Grønlandske Ordbog&mdash;is the only evidence we
have of the use of this contrivance in Greenland. This is one of the
several cases in which we only learn of the occurrence of customs, etc.,
noted at Point Barrow, in Greenland, by finding the name of the thing in
question defined in the dictionary.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "hunting_traps" id = "hunting_traps" href =

<p>Foxes are caught in the winter by deadfalls or steel traps
(nänori´a), set generally along the beach, where the foxes are wandering
about in search of carrion thrown up by the sea. In setting the
deadfalls a little house about 2 feet high is built, in which is placed
the bait of meat or blubber. A&nbsp;heavy log of driftwood is placed
across the entrance, with one end raised high enough to allow a fox to
pass under it, and supported by a regular “figure of four” of sticks.
The fox can not get at the bait without passing under the log, and in
doing so he must touch the trigger of the “figure of four” (<span class
= "sans">4</span>), which brings down the log across his back. When a
steel trap is used it is not baited itself, but buried in the snow at
the entrance of a similar little house, so that the fox can not reach
the bait without stepping on the plate of the trap and thus springing
it. Many foxes are taken with such traps in the course of the
winter.</p>

<p>The boys use a sort of snare for catching setting birds. This is
simply a strip of whalebone made into a slip-noose, which is set over
the eggs, with the end fastened to the ground, so that the bird is
caught by the leg. Once or twice, when there was a light snow on the
beach, we saw a native catching the large gulls as follows: He had a
stick of hard wood, pointed at each end, to the middle of which was
fastened one end of a stout string about 6 feet long. The other end was
secured to a stake driven into the frozen gravel, and the stick wrapped
with blubber and laid on the beach, with the string carefully hidden in
the snow. The gull came along, swallowed the lump of blubber, and as
soon as he tried to fly away the string made the sharp stick turn like a
toggle across his gullet, the points forcing their way through, so that
he was held fast. A&nbsp;similar contrivance, but somewhat smaller and
made of bone, is used at Norton Sound for catching gulls and murres,
a&nbsp;number of them being attached to a trawl line and baited with
fish. Mr. Nelson collected a large number of these.<a class = "tag" name

<p>The wooden goggles worn to protect the eyes from snow-blindness may
be considered as accessories to hunting, as they are worn chiefly by
those engaged in hunting or fishing, especially when deer-hunting in the
spring on the snow-covered tundra or when in the whaleboats among the
ice. They are simply a wooden cover for the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page261" id = "page261">
261</a></span>
eyes, admitting the light by a narrow horizontal slit, which allows only
a small amount of light to reach the eye and at the same time gives
sufficient range of vision. Such goggles are universally employed by the
Eskimos everywhere<a class = "tag" name = "tag361" id = "tag361" href =

horizontal slit with thin edges on each side of the middle. In the
middle are two notches to fit the nose, the one in the lower edge deep
and rounded, the upper very shallow. The two holes in each end are for
strings of sinew braid to pass round the head. They are neatly made and
the outside is scraped smooth and shows traces of a coat of red
ocher.</p>

<p>The history of this particular pair of goggles is peculiarly
interesting. Though differing in no important respect from those used at
the present day, they were found on the site of the ancient village of
Isû´tkwa, where our station stood, buried at a depth of 27 feet in
undisturbed frozen ground, and were uncovered in digging the shaft sunk
by Lieut. Ray for obtaining earth temperatures.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag363" id = "tag363" href = "#note363">363</a> The layer in which they
were found was evidently an old sea beach, consisting of sand and gravel
mixed with broken shells, among which Mya truncata was recognized. The
amount of the superincumbent gravel and similar material above this
object does not necessarily indicate any very great length of time since
they were first buried, as will be readily understood from what I have
said above (<a href = "PointBarrow1.html#page28">p.&nbsp;28</a>) about
the rapidity with which high hummocks of gravel are pushed up by the
ice. The unbroken layer of turf, however, nearly a foot thick, with
which the ground was covered at this point, shows that a considerable
period must have elapsed since the gravel had reached nearly to its
present level.</p>

<p>The pattern of these goggles is to my mind a very decided proof that
at that early date this region was inhabited by Eskimo not essentially
different from its present inhabitants. Goggles worn at the present day
are almost always of the shape of these, though I remember seeing one
pair made in two pieces joined by short strings of beads across the
nose. They are, I&nbsp;think, universally painted with red ocher on the
outside and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page262" id = "page262">
262</a></span>
blackened inside. They were not always made of wood, as there are two
specimens in the collection made of a piece of antler, following the
natural curve of the beam, divided longitudinally, with the softer
inside tissue hollowed out.</p>

along the top a horizontal brim about one-half inch high, which serves
for an additional shade to the eyes. Above this are two oblique holes
opening into the cavity inside, which are probably for the purpose of
ventilation, to prevent the moisture from the skin from being deposited
as frost on the inside of the goggles or on the eyelashes. I&nbsp;do not
remember having seen such goggles worn. Dall figures a similar pair from
Norton Sound, and those brought by Mr. Turner from Ungava have a similar
brim and ventilating holes. The snow goggles mentioned in Parry’s Second
Voyage (p.&nbsp;547) as occasionally seen at Iglulik, but more common in
Hudson’s Strait, appear to have resembled these, but had a brim 3 or 4

and three wing tips (three or four primaries, with the skin at the base)
of the buff-breasted sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis). This was
evidently longer when new and perhaps was originally used for a seal
indicator (which see above). Fig. 263 (No.&nbsp;89453 [1581] from
Utkiavwĭñ) is a similar rod, the tip of which has been brought to an
edge so that it can be used as a “feather-setter” in feathering arrows.
The remains of two wing tips of some small bird are tied to one of the
notches at the upper end.</p>

<h4><a name = "methods" id = "methods" href = "#top">METHODS OF
HUNTING.</a></h4>

<p>Having now described in detail all the weapons and other implements
used in hunting, I&nbsp;am prepared to give an account of the time and
methods of pursuing the different kinds of game.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "methods_polarbear" id =
"methods_polarbear" href = "#methods">The polar bear.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>Bears are occasionally met with in the winter by the seal hunters,
roaming about the ice fields at some distance from the shore. They
usually run from a man and often do not make a stand even when wounded.
Occasionally, however, a&nbsp;bear rendered bold by hunger comes in from
the sea and makes an attack on some native’s storehouse of seal meat
even in the midst of the village. Of course, in such a case he has very
little chance of escape, as the natives all turn out with their rifles
and cut off his retreat. Two bears were killed in this way at Utkiavwĭñ
in the winter of 1882-’83. The bear is always attacked with the rifle,
often with the help of dogs to bring him to bay. The umiaks when walrus
hunting sometimes meet with bears among the loose ice. If the bear is
caught in the water, there is very little difficulty in paddling up
close enough to him to shoot him.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "methods_wolf" id = "methods_wolf" href =
"#methods">The wolf.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>The wolf can hardly be considered a regular object of pursuit. Wolves
are often seen and occasionally shot by deer hunters in the winter, and
one family in the summer of 1883 managed to catch a couple of young wolf
cubs alive, somewhere between Point Barrow and the Colville. These they
brought home with them and kept them picketed on the tundra just outside
of the village, with a little kennel of snow to shelter them, carefully
feeding them till winter, when their fur had grown long enough for use
in trimming hoods. They were then
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page264" id = "page264">
264</a></span>
killed with a stone-headed arrow, which we were told was necessary for
the purpose, and their skins dressed and cut into strips which were sold
around the village. Superstition required that the man who killed these
wolves should sleep outside of the house in a tent or snow hut for “one
moon” after killing them. We did not learn the reason for this practice
beyond that it would be “bad” to do otherwise.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "methods_fox" id = "methods_fox" href =
"#methods">The fox.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>Foxes are sometimes shot, but are generally taken in the traps
described above, which are usually set some distance from the village so
as to avoid catching prowling dogs. Though generally exceedingly shy,
the fox is sometimes rendered careless by hunger. One of the women at
the deer-hunters’ camp in the spring of 1882 caught one in the little
snow house built to store the meat and killed him with a stick.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "methods_reindeer" id = "methods_reindeer"
href = "#methods">The reindeer.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>Reindeer are comparatively scarce within the radius of a day’s march
from Point Barrow, though solitary animals and small parties are to be
seen almost any day in the winter a few miles inland from the seacoast.
In the autumn, which is the rutting season, they occasionally wander
down to the lagoons back of the beach. Nearly every day in the autumn
and winter, when the weather is not stormy, one or more natives are out
looking for reindeer, usually traveling on snowshoes and carrying their
rifles slung on their backs. The deer are generally very wild and often
perceive a man and begin to run at a distance of a mile or two, though a
rutting buck will sometimes fancy that a skin-clad Eskimo is a rival
buck, and come toward him, especially if the hunter crouches down and
keeps perfectly still.</p>

<p>The usual method of hunting is to walk off inland until a deer is
sighted, when the hunter moves directly toward him at a rapid pace,
without regard to the wind or attempting to conceal himself, which would
be almost hopeless in such open country. As soon as the deer starts to
run, the hunter quickens his pace&mdash;to a run, if he has “wind”
enough&mdash;and follows the game as long as he can keep it in sight,
trusting that the well known curiosity of the deer will induce it to
“circle” round, in order to see what it is that is following him with
such pertinacity. Should the deer turn, as often happens, especially if
there is more than one of them, the hunter alters his course so as to
head him off, and as soon as he gets within long rifle range opens fire,
and keeps it up till the animal is hit or escapes out of range. Strange
as it may seem, a&nbsp;number of deer are killed every winter in this
way.</p>

<p>If a deer be killed, the hunter usually “butchers” him on the spot,
and brings in as much of the meat as he can carry on his back, leaving
the rest, carefully covered with slabs of snow to protect it from the
foxes, to be brought in as soon as convenient by a dog sled, which
follows the hunter’s tracks to the place.</p>

<p>During the spring the deer retire some distance from the Point, and
the does then drop their fawns. At this season nearly all the natives
are busily engaged in the whale fishery, and pay little attention to the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page265" id = "page265">
265</a></span>
reindeer, so that we did not learn where they went to. When the fawns
are perhaps a month old a small party, say a young man and his wife,
sometimes makes a short journey to the eastward to procure fawn skins
for clothing. They say that the fawns at this age can be caught by
running them down. During the summer again the deer come down to the
coast in small numbers, taking to the water in the lagoons, or even in
the sea, when the flies become troublesome.</p>

<p>Sometimes in warm, calm weather the flies are so numerous that the
deer is driven perfectly frantic, and runs along without looking where
he is going, so that, as the natives say, a&nbsp;hunter who places
himself in the deer’s path has no difficulty in shooting him. Flies were
unusually scarce both summers that we were at the station, so that we
never had an opportunity of seeing this done. When a deer is seen
swimming he is pursued with the kaiak and lanced in the manner already
described. In July, 1883, one man from Utkiavwĭñ made a short journey
inland, “carrying” his kaiak from lake to lake, and killed two deer in
this way without firing a shot. I&nbsp;believe this method of hunting is
frequently practiced by the parties who go east for trading in the
summer, and those who visit the rivers for the purpose of hunting.</p>

<p>The natives seemed to expect deer in summer at the lagoons, as along
the isthmus between Imê´kpûñ and Imêkpûnĭglu they had set up a range of
stakes, evidently intended to turn the deer up the beach where he would
be seen from the camp at Pernijû. Only one deer, however, came down
either summer, and he escaped without being seen. This contrivance of
setting up stakes to guide the deer in a certain direction is very
commonly used by the Eskimo. Egede gives a curious description of the
practice in Greenland in his day: They “chase them [i.e., the reindeer]
by Clap-hunting, setting upon them on all sides and surrounding them
with all their Women and Children to force them into Defiles and Narrow
Passages, where the Men armed lay in wait for them and kill them. And
when they have not People enough to surround them, then they put up
white Poles (to&nbsp;make up the Number that is wanted) with Pieces of
Turf to head them, which frightens the Deer and hinders it from
escaping.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag364" id = "tag364" href =
"#note364">364</a> Pl. 4, of the same work, is a very curious
illustration of this style of hunting.</p>

<p>A similar method is practiced at the Coppermine River, where the deer
are led by ranges of turf toward the spot where the archer is hidden.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag365" id = "tag365" href = "#note365">365</a>
Franklin also noticed between the Mackenzie and the Colville similar
ranges of driftwood stumps leading across the plain to two cairns on a
hill,<a class = "tag" name = "tag366" id = "tag366" href =
"#note366">366</a> and Thomas Simpson mentions a similar range near
Herschel Island,<a class = "tag" name = "tag367" id = "tag367" href =
"#note367">367</a> and double rows of turf to represent men leading down
to a small lake near Point Pitt, for the purpose of driving the deer
into the water where they could be speared.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag368" id = "tag368" href = "#note368">368</a> This is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page266" id = "page266">
266</a></span>
similar to the practice described by Schwatka<a class = "tag" name =
"tag369" id = "tag369" href = "#note369">369</a> among the “Netschilluk”
of King William’s Land, where a line of cairns as high as a man and 50
to 100 yards apart is built along a ridge running obliquely to the
water. When deer are seen feeding near the water the men form a skirmish
line from the last cairn to the water and advance slowly. The deer
mistake the cairns for men and take to the water, where they are easily
speared.</p>

<p>The most important deer hunt takes place in the late fall and early
spring, when the natives go inland 50 or 75 miles to the upper waters of
Kuaru and Kulugrua, where the deer are exceedingly plentiful at this
season. Capt. Herendeen, who went inland with the deer hunters in the
autumn of 1882, reports that the bottom lands of Kulugrua “looked like a
cattle yard,” from the tracks of the reindeer. They start as soon as it
is possible to travel across the country with sledges, usually about the
first of October, taking guns, ammunition, fishing tackle, and the
necessary household utensils for themselves and their families, and stay
till the daylight gets too short for hunting. In 1882, many parties got
home about October 27 or 28. At this season there is seldom snow enough
to build snow huts, so they generally live in tents, always close to the
rivers from which they procure water for household use. The men spend
their time hunting the deer, while the women bring in the game, attend
to drying the skins and the household work, and catch whitefish and
burbot through the ice of the rivers, which are now frozen hard enough
for this purpose. Some of the old men and those who have not a supply of
ammunition engage in the same pursuit.</p>

<p>A comparatively small number of the people go out to this fall deer
hunt, which appears to be a new custom, adopted since Dr. Simpson’s
time. It was probably not worth while to go out after deer at seasons
when there was not enough snow for digging pitfalls, since they depended
chiefly on these for the capture of the reindeer before the introduction
of firearms. Fully half of each village go out on the spring deer hunt,
as they did in Maguire’s time, the first parties starting out with the
return of the sun, about January 23, and the others following in the
course of two or three weeks, and remain out till about the middle of
April, when it is time to come back for the whale fishery. The people of
Utkiavwĭñ always travel to the hunting grounds by a regular road, which
is the same as that followed by Lieut. Ray in his exploring trips. They
travel along the coast on the ice wherever it is smooth enough till they
reach Sĭ´ñaru, and then strike across country, crossing Kuaru and
reaching Kulugrua near the hill Nuasu´knan. (See map, Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">II.</span>)</p>

<p>The people from Nuwŭk travel straight across Elson Bay to the south
till they reach nearly the same region. Some parties from Nuwŭk also
hunt in the rough country between Kulugrua and Ikpĭkpûñ. As the sledges
are heavily laden with camp equipage, provisions and oil for the lamps,
they travel slowly, taking four or five days for the journey,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page267" id = "page267">
267</a></span>
stopping for the night with tolerable regularity at certain stations
where the first party that travels over the trail build snow huts, which
are used by those who follow them. At the rivers they are scattered in
small camps of four or five families, about a day’s journey apart. As
well as we could learn these camps are in regularly established places,
where the same people return every year, if they hunt at all. It even
seemed as if these localities were considered the property of certain
influential families, who could allow any others they pleased to join
their parties.<a class = "tag" name = "tag370" id = "tag370" href =
"#note370">370</a> It is certain, at all events, that the people of
Utkiavwĭñ did not hunt on the Ikpĭkpûñ with the men of Nuwŭk. At this
season they live entirely in snow huts, often excavated in the deep
drifts under the river bluffs, and the men hunt deer while the women, as
before, catch fish in Kuaru and Kulugrua. None are taken in Ikpĭkpûñ.
(See above, <a href = "PointBarrow1.html#page58">p.&nbsp;58</a>.)</p>

<p>Deer are generally very plentiful at this season, though sometimes,
as happened in February, 1883, there comes a warm southerly wind which
makes them all retreat farther inland for a few days. They are generally
hunted by chasing them on snowshoes, in the manner already described,
but with much better chances of success, since when a number of hunters
are out in the same region the deer are kept moving, so that a herd
started by one hunter is very apt to run within gunshot of another. The
natives have generally very good success in this spring hunt. Two men
who were hunting on shares for the station killed upward of ninety
reindeer in the season of 1883. A&nbsp;great deal of the meat is, of
course, consumed on the spot, but a good many deer are brought home
frozen. They are skinned and brought home whole, only the heads and legs
being cut off. The latter are disjointed at the knee and elbow. These
frozen carcasses are usually cut up with a saw for cooking. At this
season the does are pregnant, and many good-sized fetuses are brought
home frozen. We were told that these were excellent food, though we
never saw them eaten. For the first two or three days after the return
of the deer hunters to the village all the little boys are playing with
these fetuses, which they set up as targets for their blunt arrows.</p>

<p>Before starting for the deer hunt the hunters generally take the
movable property which they do not mean to carry with them out of the
house and bury it in the snow for safe keeping, apparently thinking that
while a dishonest person might help himself to small articles left
around the house, he could hardly go to work and dig up a cache without
attracting the attention of the neighbors. If both families from a house
go deer hunting, they either close it up entirely or else get some
family who have no house of their own to take care of it during their
absence. During the season, small parties, traveling light, with very
little baggage, make flying trips to the village, usually to get a fresh
supply of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page268" id = "page268">
268</a></span>
ammunition or oil, and at the end of the season a lucky hunter almost
always sends in to borrow extra dogs and hire women and children to help
bring in his game. The skins, which at this season are very thick and
heavy, suitable only for blankets, heavy stockings, etc., are simply
rough dried in the open air, and brought in stacked up on a flat sled.
Lieut. Ray met a Nuwŭk party returning in 1882 with a pile of these
skins that looked like a load of hay. With such heavy loads they, of
course, travel very slowly. A&nbsp;few natives, especially when short of
ammunition, still use at this season the snow pitfalls mentioned by
Capt. Maguire.<a class = "tag" name = "tag371" id = "tag371" href =
"#note371">371</a></p>

<p>The following is the description of those seen by Lieut. Ray in 1883:
A&nbsp;round hole is dug in the drifted snow, along the bank of a stream
or lake. This is about 5 feet in diameter and 5 or 6 feet deep, and is
brought up to within 2 or 3 inches of the surface, where there is only a
small hole, through which the snow was removed. This is carefully closed
with a thin slab of snow and baited by strewing reindeer moss and
bunches of grass over the thin surface, through which the deer breaks as
soon as he steps on it. The natives say that they sometimes get two deer
at once.</p>

<p>This method of hunting the reindeer appears uncommon among the
Eskimo. I&nbsp;find no mention of it except at Repulse Bay,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag372" id = "tag372" href = "#note372">372</a> and among
the Netsillingmiut, where dogs’ urine is said to be sprinkled on the
snow as a bait to attract the deer by its “Salzgehalt.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag373" id = "tag373" href = "#note373">373</a> Lieut. Ray was
informed by the natives that the “Nunatañmiun” also captured deer by
means of a rawhide noose set across a regular deer path, when they
discovered such. The noose is held up and spread by a couple of sticks,
and the end staked to the ground with a piece of antler. A&nbsp;similar
method was practiced by the natives of Norton Sound.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag374" id = "tag374" href = "#note374">374</a> A&nbsp;few
parties visit the rivers in summer for the purpose of hunting reindeer,
but most of the natives are either off on the trading expeditions
previously mentioned or else settled in the small camps along the coast,
3&nbsp;or 4 miles apart, whence they occasionally go a short distance
inland in search of reindeer.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "methods_seal" id = "methods_seal" href =
"#methods">The seal.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>The flesh of the smaller seals forms such a staple of food, and their
blubber and skin serve so many important purposes, that their capture is
one of the most necessary pursuits at Point Barrow, and is carried on at
all seasons of the year and in many different methods. During the season
of open water many seals are shot from the umiaks engaged in whaling and
walrus hunting or caught in nets set along the shore at Elson Bay. This
is also the only season when seals can be captured with the small kaiak
darts.</p>

<p>The principal seal fishery, however, begins with the closing of the
sea, usually about the middle of October. When the pack ice comes in
there are usually many small open pools, to which the seals resort for
air. Most of the able-bodied men in the village are out every day armed
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page269" id = "page269">
269</a></span>
with the rifle and retrieving harpoon, traveling many miles among the
ice hummocks in search of such holes. When a seal shows his head he is
shot at with the rifle, and the hunter, if successful, secures his game
with the harpoon. This method of hunting is practiced throughout the
winter wherever open holes form in the ice. A&nbsp;native going to visit
his nets or to examine the condition of the ice always carries his rifle
and retrieving harpoon, in case he should come across an open hole where
seals might be found. The hunt at this season is accompanied with
considerable danger, as the ice pack is not yet firmly consolidated and
portions of it frequently move offshore with a shift of the wind, so
that the hunter runs the risk of being carried out to sea. The natives
exercise considerable care, and generally avoid crossing a crack if the
wind, however light, is blowing offshore; but in spite of their
precautions men are every now and then carried off to sea and never
return.</p>

<p>The hunters meet with many exciting adventures. On the morning of
November 24, 1882, all the heavy ice outside of the bar broke away from
the shore, leaving a wide lead, and began to move rapidly to the
northeast, carrying with it three seal hunters. They were fortunately
near enough to the village to be seen by the loungers on the village
hill, who gave the alarm. An umiak was immediately mounted on a flat
sled and carried out over the shore ice with great rapidity, so that the
men were easily rescued. The promptness and energy with which the people
at the village acted showed how well the danger was appreciated.</p>

<p>At this season of the year a single calm night is sufficient to cover
all the holes and leads with young ice strong enough to support a man,
and occasionally before the pack comes in the open sea freezes over. In
this young ice the seals make their breathing holes (adlu), “about the
Bigness of a Halfpenny,” as Egede says, and the natives employ the
stabbing harpoon for their capture. At the present day this is seldom
used alone, but the seal is shot through the head as he comes to the
surface, and the spear only used to secure him. Seals which have been
shot in this way are sometimes carried off by the current before they
can be harpooned. As far as I can learn, this practice of shooting seals
at the adlu is peculiar to Point Barrow (including probably the rest of
the Arctic coast as far as Kotzebue Sound), though the use of the
<i>una</i>, as already stated, is very general.</p>

<p>This method of hunting can generally be prosecuted only a few days at
a time, as the movements of the pack soon break up the fields of young
ice, though new fields frequently form in the course of the season.
After the January gales the pack is so firmly consolidated that there
are no longer any open holes or leads, and when the spring leads open
young ice seldom forms, so that this method of hunting is as a rule
confined to the period between the middle of October and the early part
of January.</p>

<p>With the departure of the sun, about the middle of November, begins
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page270" id = "page270">
270</a></span>
the netting, which is the most important fishery of the year, but which
can be prosecuted with success only in the darkest nights. The natives
say that even a bright aurora interferes with the netting. At this
season narrow leads of open water are often formed parallel to the
shore, and frequently remain open for several days. The natives are
constantly reconnoitering the ice in search of such leads, and when one
is found nearly all the men in the village go out to it with their nets.
A&nbsp;place is sought where the ice is tolerably level and not too
thick for about a hundred yards back from the lead, at which distance
the nets are set, often a number of them close together, in the manner
already described, so that they hang like curtains under the ice,
parallel to the edge of the open water. When darkness comes on the
hunters begin to rattle on the ice with their ice picks, scratch with
the seal call, or make some other gentle and continuous noise, which
soon excites the curiosity of the seals that are swimming about in the
open lead. One at length dives under the ice and swims in the direction
of the sound, which of course leads him directly into the net, where he
is entangled.</p>

<p>On favorable nights a great many seals are captured in this way. For
instance, on the night of December 2, 1882, the netters from Utkiavwĭñ
alone took at least one hundred seals. Such lucky hauls are not common,
however. As the weather at this season is often excessively cold, the
seals freeze stiff soon after they are taken from the net, and if
sufficient snow has fallen they are stacked up by sticking their hind
flippers in the snow. This keeps them from being covered up and lost if
the snow begins to drift. I&nbsp;have counted thirty seals, the property
of one native, piled up in this way into a single stack. The women and
children go out at their convenience with dog sleds and bring in the
seals. A&nbsp;woman, however, who is at work on deerskin clothing must
not touch a hand to the seals or the sled on which they are loaded, but
may lend a hand at hauling on the drag line. When the seals are brought
to the edge of the beach they must not be taken on land till each has
been given a mouthful of fresh water. We did not learn the object of
this practice, but Nordenskiöld, who observed a similar custom at
Pitlekaj, was informed that it was to keep the leads from closing.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag375" id = "tag375" href =
"#note375">375</a></p>

<p>When the lead keeps open for several days, or there is a prospect of
its opening again, the hunter leaves his gear out on the ice, sometimes
bringing his ice pick, scoop, and setting pole part way home and
sticking them up in the snow alongside of the path. In 1884 a lead
remained open for several days about 3 or 4 miles from the village, and
the natives made a regular beaten trail out to it. When we visited the
netting ground the lead had closed, but nearly all the men had left
their gear sticking up near it, with the nets tied up and hung upon the
ice picks. They had built little walls of snow slabs as a protection
against the wind. The season for this netting ends with the January
gales, which close the leads permanently.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page271" id = "page271">
271</a></span>
<p>Later in the winter the seals resort to very inconsiderable cracks
among the hummocks for air, and nets are set hanging around these
cracks, so that a seal can not approach the crack without being caught.
There was such a crack just in the edge of the rough land floe, not half
a mile from Utkiavwĭñ, in February, 1883, from which two men took
several seals, visiting the nets every day or two. Those men who do not
go off on the deer hunt keep one or more seal nets set all winter,
either in this way or in the third method, which can be practiced only
after the daylight has come back, when the ice is thick. At this season
there are frequently to be found among the hummocks what the natives
call <i>i´glus</i>, dome-shaped snow houses about 6 feet in diameter and
2 or 3 feet high, with a smooth round hole in the top, and communicating
with the water. These are undoubtedly the same as the snow burrows
described by Kumlien,<a class = "tag" name = "tag376" id = "tag376" href
= "#note376">376</a> which the female seal builds to bring forth her
young in.<a class = "tag" name = "tag377" id = "tag377" href =
"#note377">377</a> They are curious constructions, looking astonishingly
like a man’s work. The natives told me that nets set at these places
were for the capture of young seals (nĕtyiáru). It appears that these
houses are the property of a single female only until her young one is
able to take to the water, as a net is kept set at one of these holes,
as well as I could understand, sometimes capturing several seals. The
net is set flat under the hole, the corners being drawn out by cords let
down through small holes in a circle round the main opening, through
which the net is drawn. A&nbsp;seal rising to the surface runs his head
through the meshes of the net. The small holes and sometimes the middle
one are carefully covered with slabs of snow.</p>

<p>The officers of the revenue steamer <i>Corwin</i>, who made the
sledge journey along the northeast coast of Siberia in the early summer
of 1881, saw seal nets set in this way, flat, under air holes in the
ice, with a hole for each corner of the net. When a seal was caught the
net was drawn up through the middle hole with a hooked pole.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag378" id = "tag378" href = "#note378">378</a> In 1883
they began setting these nets at Point Barrow about March 4, and
probably about the same date the year before, though we did not happen
to observe this method of netting until considerably later.</p>

<p>In June and July, when the ice becomes rotten and worn into holes,
the seals “haul out” to bask in the sun, and are then stalked and shot.
They are exceedingly wary at this season. The seal usually taken in the
methods above described is the rough or ringed seal (Phoca fœtida), but
in 1881 a single male ribbon seal (Histriophoca fasciata) was netted,
and in 1882 a native shot one at the breathing hole, but it was carried
away by the current before he could secure it. The natives said that
they sometimes caught the harbor seal (P.&nbsp;vitulina) in the shore
nets in Elson Bay. The bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), whose skin is
especially prized for making harpoon lines, boot soles, umiak covers,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page272" id = "page272">
272</a></span>
etc., is never very abundant, and occurs chiefly in the season of open
water, when it is captured from the umiak with harpoon and rifle, but
they are sometimes found in the winter, as two were killed at breathing
holes in the rough ice January 8, 1883.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "methods_walrus" id = "methods_walrus" href
= "#methods">The walrus.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>The walrus occurs only during the season of open water, and is almost
always captured from the umiak with the large harpoon and rifle. The
whaling boats usually find a few, especially late in the season, and
after the trading parties have gone in the summer the natives who remain
are generally out in the boats a good deal of the time looking for
walrus and seals. As a general thing walrus are especially plenty in
September, when much loose ice is moving backwards and forwards with the
current, frequently sleeping in large herds upon cakes of ice. The
boats, which are out nearly every day at this season with volunteer
crews, not regularly organized as for whaling, paddle as near as they
can to these sleeping herds and try to shoot them in the head, aiming
also to “fasten” to as many as they can with the harpoon and float as
they hurry into the water. A&nbsp;harpooned walrus is followed up with
the boat and shot with the rifle when a chance is offered. Swimming
walruses are chased with the boat and “fastened to” by darting the
harpoon. When a walrus is killed it is towed up to the nearest cake of
ice and cut up on the spot. We never knew of the kaiak being used in
walrus-hunting, as is the custom among the eastern Eskimo.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "methods_whale" id = "methods_whale" href =
"#methods">The whale.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>The pursuit of the “bowhead” whale (Balæna mysticetus), so valuable
not only for the food furnished by its flesh and “blackskin” and the oil
from its blubber, but for the whalebone, which serves so many useful
purposes in the arts of the Eskimo and is besides the chief article of
trade with the ships, is carried on with great regularity and formality.
In the first place all the umialĭks (boat-owners) or those who are to be
the captains of whaling umiaks, before the deer hunters start out in
January, bring all the gear to be used in the whale fishery to the
kû´dyĭgĭ, where it is consecrated by a ceremony consisting of drumming
and singing, perhaps partaking of the nature of an incantation.</p>

<p>Capt. Herendeen was the only one of our party who witnessed this
ceremony, which took place at Utkiavwĭñ on January 9, 1883, and he did
not bring back a detailed account of the proceedings. During part of the
ceremony all the umialĭks were seated in a row upon the floor, and a
woman passed down the line marking each across the face with an oblique
streak of blacklead. As soon as the deer hunters return in the spring
they begin getting ready for the whales, covering the boats, fitting
lines to harpoons, and putting gear of all sorts in perfect order. Every
article to be used in whaling&mdash;harpoons, lances, paddles, and even
the timbers of the boats&mdash;must be scraped perfectly clean.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag379" id = "tag379" href = "#note379">379</a> This
work is generally done by the umialĭk himself and his
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page273" id = "page273">
273</a></span>
family, as the crews do not enter on their duties till the whaling
actually commences. The crews are regularly organized for the season,
and are made up during the winter and early spring. They consist of
eight or ten persons to each boat, including the captain, who is always
the owner of the boat, and sits in the stern and steers, using a larger
paddle than the rest, and the harpooner, who occupies the bow. When a
bombgun is carried it is intrusted to a third man, who sits in the waist
of the boat, and whose duty it is to shoot the whale whenever he sees a
favorable opportunity, whether it has been harpooned or not. The rest
are simply paddlers.</p>

<p>When used for whaling, the umiak is propelled by paddles alone, sails
and oars never being even taken on board. Men are preferred for the
whaling crews when enough can be secured, otherwise the vacancies are
filled by women, who make efficient paddlers. Some umialĭks hire their
crews, paying them a stipulated price in tobacco and other articles, and
providing them with food during the season. Others ship men on shares.
We did not learn the exact proportions of these shares in any case. They
appear to concern the whalebone alone, as all seem to be entitled to as
much of the flesh and blubber as they can cut off in the general
scramble. At this season exploring parties are out every day examining
the state of the ice to ascertain when the pack is likely to break away
from the landfloe, and also to find the best path for the umiaks through
the hummocks.</p>

<p>In 1882 the condition of the ice was such that the boats could be
taken out directly from Utkiavwĭñ, by a somewhat winding path, to the
edge of the land floe about five or six miles from the shore. This path
was marked out by the seal-hunters during the winter, and some of the
natives spent their leisure time widening and improving it, knocking off
projecting points of ice with picks and whale spades, and filling up the
worst of the inequalities. Much of the path, however, was exceedingly
rough and difficult when it was considered finished. In 1883 the land
floe was so rough and wide abreast of the village that no practicable
path could be made, so all the whalemen with their families moved up to
Imê´kpûñ and encamped in tents as already described (see <a href =
"PointBarrow1.html#page84">p.&nbsp;84</a>) for the season. From this
point a tolerably straight and easy path was made out to the edge of the
land floe. The natives informed me as early as April 1 that it would be
necessary for them to move up to Imê´kpûñ, adding that the ice abreast
of the village was very heavy and would move only when warm weather
came. This prediction was correct, as the season of 1883 was so late
that no ships reached the station until August 1.</p>

<p>About the middle of April the natives begin anxiously to expect an
east or southeast wind (nígyǝ) to drive off the pack and open the leads,
and should it not speedily blow from that quarter recourse is had to
supernatural means to bring it. A&nbsp;party of men go out and sit in a
semicircle facing the sea on the village cliff, while one man in the
middle
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page274" id = "page274">
274</a></span>
beats a drum and sings a monotonous chant, interrupted by curious
vibrating cries, accompanied with a violent shaking of the head from
side to side. This ceremony is conducted with great solemnity, and the
natives seemed disinclined to have us witness it, so that we learned
very little about it. They, however, told us that the chant was
addressed to a tuaña or spirit, requesting him to make the desired wind
blow.<a class = "tag" name = "tag380" id = "tag380" href =
"#note380">380</a> It does not appear to be necessary that the man who
delivers the invocation should be a regular magician or “doctor.”
A&nbsp;succession of unsuccessful attempts were made in 1882, some of
them by men who never to our knowledge practiced incantations on other
occasions. During this period, and while the whaling is going on, no
pounding must be done in the village, and it is not allowable even to
rap with the knuckles on wood for fear of frightening away the whales.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag381" id = "tag381" href = "#note381">381</a> It
is interesting to find that at Norton Sound, where the whale is not
pursued, this superstition has been transferred to the salmon fishery,
one of the most important industries of the year. Mr. Dall<a class =
"tag" name = "tag382" id = "tag382" href = "#note382">382</a> says:
“While the fishery lasts no wood must be cut with an axe, or the salmon
will disappear.”</p>

<p>As soon as the lead opens, and sometimes before when the prospect
looks promising, the boats are taken out to the edge of the land floe
and kept out there during the season, which lasts till about the last
week in June, when they are brought in and got ready for the summer
expeditions. When the lead closes, as often happens, the boats are
hauled up on the ice and many or all of the crews come home until there
are prospects of open water. When there is open water, the boats are
always on the lookout for whales, either cruising about in the lead or
lying up at the edge of the floe, the crews eating and sleeping when
they can get a chance and shooting seals and ducks when there are no
whales in sight. The women and children travel back and forth between
the village and the boats, carrying supplies of food for the
whalemen.</p>

<p>In 1883, there was a regular beaten trail along the smooth shore ice
between Imê´kpûñ and Utkiavwĭñ, where people were constantly traveling
back and forth. When the boats are out no woman is allowed to sew, as
was noticed by Dr. Simpson.<a class = "tag" name = "tag383" id =
"tag383" href = "#note383">383</a> To carry the umiak out over the ice
it is lashed on a flat sled and drawn by dogs and men.
A&nbsp;description of one of these boats which I accompanied for part of
its journey out to the open water, will show how a whaleboat is fitted
out. The rifles, harpoons, lances, and other gear of the party were sent
on ahead on a sled drawn by half a dozen dogs, with a woman to lead
them. After these had made a short stage, they were unfastened from this
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page275" id = "page275">
275</a></span>
sled and brought back and harnessed to the flat sled on which the umiak
was lashed. The party, which consisted of five men and two women, one of
whom remained with the sled load of gear, then started ahead, the women
running in front of the dogs and the men pushing at the sides of the
boat. The boat travels very easily and rapidly on smooth ice, but among
the hummocks the men have hard work pushing and scrambling, and
occasional stops have to be made to widen narrow places in the path and
to chisel off projecting points of ice which might pierce the skin cover
of the boat. When they came up to the first sled the women were again
sent on with this while the men rested. The inflated sealskin floats,
five or six in number, the whale harpoon, and whale spades, and ice
picks were carried in the boats.</p>

<p>A whaling umiak always carries a number of amulets to insure success.
These consisted in this case of two wolf skulls, a&nbsp;dried raven, the
axis vertebra of a seal, and numerous feathers. The skin of a golden
eagle is considered an excellent charm for whaling, and Nĭkawaalu was
particularly desirous to secure the tip of a red fox’s tail, which he
said was a powerful amulet. The captain and harpooner wore fillets of
mountain sheepskin, with a little crystal or stone image of a whale
dangling at each side of the face, and the captain’s fillet was also
fringed with the incisor teeth of the mountain sheep. Both wore little
stone whales attached to the breast of the jacket, and one woman and one
or two of the men had streaks of black lead on their faces.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag384" id = "tag384" href = "#note384">384</a></p>

<p>When they are on the watch for whales the great harpoon is kept
always rigged and resting in a crotch of ivory in the bow of the boat.
When a whale is sighted they paddle up as close as possible and the
harpooner thrusts the harpoon into him. The whale dives, with the floats
attached to him, and the shaft, which is retained, is rigged for
striking him when he rises again. The other boats, if any are near, join
in the chase until the whale is so wearied that he can be lanced or a
favorable opportunity occurs for shooting him. All boats in sight at the
time the whale is struck, as I understood, are entitled to an equal
share of the whalebone.</p>

<p>As soon as the whale is killed he is towed up to the edge of the land
floe and everybody standing on the edge of the ice and in the boats
begins hacking away, at random, at the flesh and blubber, some of them
going to work more carefully to cut out the whalebone. The “cutting in”
is managed without order or control, everybody who can be on the spot
being apparently entitled to all the meat, blubber, and blackskin he or
she can cut off. The same custom was practiced in Greenland, and is to
this day in eastern Siberia.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page276" id = "page276">
276</a></span>
<p>While they are very particular in all superstitious observances
regarding the whales, they are less careful about certain things, such
as loud talking and firing guns at seals and fowl when they are waiting
for whales, which really hurt their chances with the timid animals. They
are less energetic than one would suppose in pursuit of the whale,
according to Capt. Herendeen, who spent several days each season with
the whaleboats. Instead of cruising about the lead in search of whales
they are rather inclined to lie in wait for them at the edge of the
floe, so that when the open water is wide many whales escape.</p>

<p>When the leads are very narrow the whales are sometimes shot with the
bombgun from the edge of the ice. Success in this appears to be
variable. In 1882 only one small whale was secured, and in 1883 one
full-grown one, though several were struck and lost each season. The
veteran whaling-master, Capt. L.&nbsp;C. Owen, informs me that one
season the boats of these two villages captured ten. The season of 1885
was very successful. The natives of the two villages are reported to
have taken twenty-eight whales. Capt. E.&nbsp;E. Smith, however, informs
me that only seven of these were full-grown.</p>

<p>When actually engaged in whaling the umialik exercises a very fair
degree of discipline, but at other times he seems hardly able to keep
his men from straggling off to go home or to visit their seal nets,
etc., so that he sometimes has to chase a whale “short-handed.”</p>

<p>Nowhere else among the Eskimo does the whale fishery appear to be
conducted in such regular manner with formally organized crews as upon
this northwest coast. From all accounts the animal is only casually
pursued elsewhere with fleets of kaiaks or umiaks manned by volunteer
crews.<a class = "tag" name = "tag385" id = "tag385" href =
"#note385">385</a></p>

<p>The beluga or white whale is only casually pursued, and as far as I
could learn is always shot with the rifle. It is not abundant.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "methods_fowl" id = "methods_fowl" href =
"#methods">Fowl.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>During the winter months a few ptarmigan are occasionally shot, but
the natives pay no special attention to birds until the spring
migrations. The first ducks appear a little later than the whales, about
the end of April or the first week of May, and from that time till the
middle of June scarcely a day passes when they are not more or less
plenty. The king ducks (Somateria spectabilis) are the first to appear,
while the Pacific eiders (S.&nbsp;v-nigra) arrive somewhat later, and
are more abundant towards the end of the migrations. At this season all
women and children, and many men, go armed with the bolas, and everybody
is always on the lookout for flocks of ducks. On four or five favorable
days each season, at intervals of a week or ten days, there are great
flights of eiders coming up in huge flocks of two or three hundred,
stretched out in long diagonal lines. These flocks follow one another in
rapid succession and keep the line of the coast, apparently striking
straight across Peard Bay from the Seahorse Islands to a point
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page277" id = "page277">
277</a></span>
four or five miles below Utkiavwĭñ, and most of them fly up along the
smooth shore-ice to Pernyû or Point Barrow. Some flocks always fly up
among the hummocks of the land floe, and a few others turn eastward
below the village and continue their course to the northeast across the
land.</p>

<p>On the days between the great flights there are always a few flocks
passing, and some days when there is no flight along shore they are very
abundant out at the open water, where the whalemen shoot them in the
intervals of whaling. When a great flight begins the people at the
village hasten out and form a sort of skirmish line across the shore ice
from the shore to the hummocks, a&nbsp;few sometimes stationing
themselves among the latter. They take but little pains to conceal
themselves, frequently sitting out on the open ice-field on sealing
stools or squares of bearskins. The ducks generally keep on their course
without paying much attention to the men, and in fact one may often get
a shot by running so as to head off an approaching flock. Firing,
however, frightens them and makes them rise to a considerable height,
often out of gunshot. Many ducks are taken with guns and bolas in these
flights.</p>

<p>Rather late in the season the old squaws (Clangula hyemalis) pass to
the northeast in large flocks, but usually go so high than none are
taken. A&nbsp;good many of these, however, with a few eiders, geese,
brant, and loons, remain and breed on the tundra, and are occasionally
shot by the natives, though most of them are too busy with whaling and
seal and walrus hunting to pay much attention to birds. Small parties of
two or three lads or young men, sometimes with their wives, make short
excursions inland to the small streams and sand islands east of Point
Barrow, after birds and eggs, and the boys from the small camps along
the coast towards Woody Inlet are always on the lookout for eggs and
small birds, such as they can kill with their bows and arrows or catch
in snares. They say that the parties which go east, and those which
visit the rivers in summer, get many eggs and find plenty of ducks,
geese, and swans, which have molted their flight feathers so that they
are unable fly.</p>

<p>About the end of July the return migration of the ducks begins. At
this season the flocks, which are generally smaller and more compact
than in the spring, come from the east along the northern shore, and
cross out to sea at the isthmus of Pernyû, where the natives assemble in
large numbers to shoot them as well as to meet with the Nunatañmiun. All
the people who have been scattered along the coast in small camps
gradually collect at this season at Pernyû, and the returning eastern
parties generally stop there two or three days; while, after they have
brought their families back to the village, the men frequently walk up
to Pernyû for a day or two of duck shooting. The tents are pitched just
in the bend of Elson Bay, and north of them is a narrow place in the
sandspit over which the ducks often pass. Here the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page278" id = "page278">
278</a></span>
natives dig shallow pits in the gravel, in which they post themselves
with guns and bolas. A&nbsp;line of posts is set up along the bend of
the beach from the tents almost to the outlet of Imêkpûniglu.</p>

<p>When a light breeze is blowing from the northeast the ducks, no
matter how far off shore they are when first seen, always head for the
point of land on the other side of this outlet, probably with the
intention of following the line of lagoons and going out to sea farther
down the coast, as they sometimes do. When, however, they reach this
critical point they catch sight of the posts, and the natives who are
watching them sharply set up a shrill yell. Frightened by this and by
the line of posts, nine times out of ten, if the cry is given at the
right moment, the ducks will falter, become confused, and, finally,
collecting into a compact body will whirl along the line of posts, past
the tents, flying close to the water, and turn out to sea at the first
open space, which is just where the gunners are posted. This habit of
yelling to frighten the ducks and bring them within gunshot has been
observed on the Siberian coast in places where the ducks are in the
habit of flying in and out from lagoons over low bars.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag386" id = "tag386" href = "#note386">386</a> Should the wind
blow hard from the east, however, or blow from any other quarter, the
ducks do not fly in such abundance, nor do they pay much attention to
the posts or the yelling, but often keep on their course down the
lagoons, or head straight for the beach and cross wherever they strike
it. The latter is generally the habit with the old squaws, who come
rather late in the migrations, while the black brant (Branta nigricans)
are more apt to go down the lagoons. A&nbsp;few pintail ducks (Dafila
acuta), are occasionally shot at this season, and are sometimes found in
the two little village ponds (Tûseraru). The shooting at Pernyû usually
lasts till the middle or end of September, during which month the
natives also shoot a good many gulls (Larus barrovianus and Rhodostethia
rosea) as they fly along the shore.</p>

FISHING.</a></h4>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "fishing_hooks" id = "fishing_hooks" href =
"#fishing">Hooks and lines.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>The streams and lakes in the immediate neighborhood of Point Barrow
contain no fish, and there is comparatively little fishing in the sea.
When the water first closes in the autumn narrow tide cracks often form
at the very edge of the beach. At these cracks the natives frequently
catch considerable numbers of Polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and small
sculpins (Cottus quadricornis and C.&nbsp;decastrensis), with the hook
and line. The tackle for this fishing consists of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page279" id = "page279">
279</a></span>
a short line of whalebone, provided with a little “squid” or artificial
bait of ivory, and fastened to a wooden rod about 18 inches or 2 feet
long. The lure, which is apparently meant to represent a small shrimp,
is kept moving, and the fish bite at it. We brought home two complete
sets of tackle for this kind of fishing, two lines without rods and
twelve lures or hooks. No. 89548 [1733] Fig. 264, has been selected for
description.</p>

<p>The line is 40 inches long and made of four strips of whalebone 0.1
inch wide, fastened together with what appear to be “waterknots.” Two of
these strips are of black whalebone, respectively 4½ and 9 inches long;
the other two are of light colored whalebone and 15½ and 11 inches long.
The light colored end is made fast to the eye in the small end of the
hook as follows: The end is passed through the eye, doubled back and
passed through a single knot in the standing part, and knotted round the
latter with a similar knot (Fig. 265). This knot is the one generally
used in fastening a fishing line to the hook. The other end is doubled
in a short bight into which is becket-hitched one end of a bit of sinew
thread about 3 inches long, and the other end is knotted into a notch at
one end of the rod, as the whalebone would be too stiff to tie securely
to the stick. The rod is a roughly whittled splinter of California
redwood, 14½ inches long. The body of the lure is a piece of walrus
ivory 1½ inches long. Through a hole in the large end of this is driven
the barbless brass hook, with a broad thin plate at one end bent up,
flush with the convex side. When not in use the line is reeled
lengthwise on the rod, secured by a notch at each end of the latter, and
the hook stuck into the wood on one side of the rod. The hook is wedged
into the body of the lure with a bit of whalebone. The other specimen,
No. 89547, [1733] from the same village, is almost exactly like this,
but has a slightly shorter line, made of three strips of bone, of which
the lower two, as before, are of light colored whalebone. The object of
using this material is probably to render the part of the line which is
under water less conspicuous, as we use leaders and casting lines of
transparent silkworm gut. The body of the lure is made of old brown
walrus ivory. These lures are 1 inch to 1½ inches long, and vary little
in the shape of the body which is usually made of walrus ivory, in most
cases darkened on the surface by age or charring, so that when carved
into shape it is parti-colored, black and white. The body is often
ornamented with small colored beads inlaid for eyes and along the back
(Fig. 266<i>a</i>, No. 56609 [153], from Utkiavwĭñ).</p>

<p>The hook is usually of the shape described but is sometimes simply a
slightly recurved spur about ½-inch long as in Fig. 266<i>b</i>
(No.&nbsp;56610 [160],
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page280" id = "page280">
280</a></span>
also from Utkiavwĭñ). It is usually of brass or copper, rarely of iron.
Two peculiar lures from Utkiavwĭñ, are No. 56705 [150<i>a</i> and
150<i>b</i>]. The first, <i>a</i>, has a body of brass of the usual
shape, and a copper hook, and the other, <i>b</i>, has the body made of
a strip of thin brass to the back of which is fastened a lump of lead or
pewter. The hook appears to be made of a common copper tack. We were
informed that these lures were also used for catching small fish, trout,
smelts, and perhaps grayling in the rivers in summer. No. 89554 [950],
Fig. 267<i>a</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ, is perhaps intended exclusively for
this purpose, as it is larger than the others, (1.9 inch long) and
highly ornamented with beads. Fig. 267<i>b</i>, No. 89783 [1007], is one
of these beaded lures (2½&nbsp;inches long), with an iron hook,
undoubtedly for river fishing, as it belonged to the “inland” native,
Ilû´bw’ga. It differs slightly in shape from the others, having two eyes
at the small end into which is fastened a leader of sinew braid 3 inches
long. On this are strung four blue glass beads and one red one.</p>

pine, 27 inches long. One line is 43 and the other 36 inches long and
each is made of two strips of whalebone of which the lower is light
colored as usual. The shorter line carries a small plain ivory lure of
the common pattern, and the longer one a little flat barbless hook of
copper with a broad flat shank. This was probably scraped bright and
used without bait. The lines are reeled in the usual manner on the rod,
and the hooks caught into notches on the sides of it. The small lures
are called nĭ´ksĭñ.</p>

281</a></span>
<p>When at the rivers in the autumn and early spring, they fish for
burbot with a line carrying a peculiar large hook called iɐkqlûñ, which
is baited with a piece of whitefish. There are two forms of this hook,
which is from 3 to 5¼ inches long. One form differs in size only from
the small nĭ´ksĭn, but is always of white ivory and not beaded (Fig.
269, No. 89550 [780] from Utkiavwĭñ, which is 4½ inches long and has a
copper hook). The hook is of copper, brass or iron. The other form,
which is perhaps the commoner, has a narrow flat body, slightly bent,
and serrated on the edges to give a firm attachment to the bait. This
body is usually of antler, and has a copper or iron hook either
spur-shaped or of the common form as in Fig. 270, No. 89553 [764] from
Utkiavwĭñ, which has a body of walrus ivory 4 inches long and a copper
hook. Of late years, small cod hooks obtained from the ships have been
adapted to these bodies, as is seen in Fig. 271, No. 89552 [841] from
Utkiavwĭñ. The shank of the hook has been half imbedded in a
longitudinal groove on the flatter side of the body, with the bend of
the hook projecting about ¼ inch beyond the tip of the latter. The ring
of the hook has been bent open and the end sunk into the body. The hook
is held on by two lashings of sinew, one at each end of the shank.</p>

<p>No. 56594 [32] from Utkiavwĭñ is like the preceding, but has a larger
hook, which from the bend to the point is wrapped in a piece of deer
skin with the flesh side out, and wound with sinew having a tuft of hair
at the point of the hook. This is probably to hide the point when the
hook is baited. No. 56594 [167] from Utkiavwĭñ, has the hook fastened to
the back of the body instead of the flat side. The manner in which these
hooks are baited is shown in Fig. 272, which represents a complete set
of burbot tackle (No.&nbsp;89546 [946]) brought in and sold by some
Utkiavwĭñ natives, just as they had been using it in the autumn of 1882
at Kuaru or Kulugrua. A&nbsp;piece of whitefish, flesh and skin, with
the scales removed is wrapped round the hook so as to make a club-shaped
body 4½ inches long and is sewed up along one side with cotton twine.
The copper spur projects through the skin on the other side.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page282" id = "page282">
282</a></span>
This hook would not hold the fish unless it were “gorged,” but the
voracious burbot always swallows its prey. In dressing these fish for
the table, whitefish of considerable size were frequently found in them.
The line is of whalebone like those already described but a little
stouter, 78 inches long, and made of seven pieces, all black. The end of
the line is fastened into an eye in the small end of a rough club-shaped
sinker of walrus ivory, 4¾ inches long. There is another eye at the
large end of the sinker, for the attachment of a leader of double sinew
braid 5½ inches long connecting the hook with the sinker.</p>

<p>The reel, which serves also as a short rod, is of yellow pine 19½
inches long. When the line is reeled up, the hook is caught into the
wood on one side of the reel. No. 89545 [946] is a similar set of baited
tackle, bought from the same natives, differing from the preceding only
in proportions, having a longer line&mdash;9 feet and 6 inches&mdash;and
a somewhat larger bait. We also procured two sets of burbot tackle
unbaited.</p>

<p>One of these (No. 56543 [33] from Utkiavwĭñ) has a whalebone line 14
feet long, and a roughly octahedral sinker of walrus ivory 3 inches long
and 1½ in diameter. The hook, which is joined to the sinker as before by
a leader of stout sinew braid, is of the second pattern, with serrated
edges, and a copper hook. The leader is neatly spliced into this. The
other, No. 56544 [187], also from Utkiavwĭñ, has no sinker and a hook
with a club-shaped body and iron spur. It was probably put together for
sale, as it is new. The sinkers, of which we collected five, besides
those already mentioned, are always about the same weight and either
club-shaped or roughly octahedral. They are always of walrus ivory and
usually carelessly made. Fig. 273 (No.&nbsp;56577 [260]) represents one
of these sinkers (kíbica), on which there is some attempt at
ornamentation. On the larger are two eyes and the outline of a mouth
like a shark’s, incised and filled in with black refuse oil.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 274.&mdash;Ivory jigger for polar
cod.</p>
</div>

<p>A similar line and reel are used for catching polar cod in the spring
and late winter through the ice at some distance from the shore. These
lines are 10 or 15 fathoms long, and provided with a heavy sinker of
ivory, copper, or rarely lead, to which are attached by whalebone
leaders of unequal length, two little jiggers like Fig. 274 (the
property of the writer, from Utkiavwĭñ). This is of white walrus ivory,
2⅛ inches long and ⅜ in diameter at the largest part. The two slender
hooks are of copper and are secured by wedges of whalebone. This makes a
contrivance resembling the squid jigs used by our fishermen. These
jiggers are sometimes made wholly of copper, which is scraped
bright.</p>

<p>This fishery begins with the return of the sun, about the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page283" id = "page283">
283</a></span>
1st of February, and continues when the ice is favorable until the
season is so far advanced that the ice has begun to melt and become
rotten. The fish are especially to be found in places where there is a
good-sized field of the season’s ice, 3&nbsp;or 4 feet thick, inclosed
by hummocks, and they sometimes occur in very great numbers. In 1882
there was a large field of this kind about 2 miles from the village and
the fishing was carried on with great success, but in 1883 the ice was
so much broken that the fish were very scarce. Some lads caught a few
early in the season, but the fishery was soon abandoned.</p>

<p>A hole about a foot in diameter is made through the ice with an ice
pick, and the fragments dipped out either with the long-handled
whalebone scoop, or the little dipper made of two pieces of antler
mounted on a handle about 2 feet long, which everybody carries in the
winter. The line is unreeled and let down through the hole till the jigs
hang about a foot from the bottom. The fisherman holds in his left hand
the dipper above mentioned, with which he keeps the hole clear of the
ice crystals, which form very quickly, and in his right the reel which
he jerks continually up and down. The fish, attracted by the white
“jiggers,” begin nosing around them, when the upward jerk of the line
hooks one of them in the under jaw or the belly. As soon as the
fisherman feels the fish, he catches a bight of the line with the scoop
in his left hand and draws it over to the left; then catches the line
below this with the reel and draws it over to the right, and so on, thus
reeling the line up in long hanks on these two sticks, without touching
the wet line with his fingers.</p>

<p>When the fish is brought to the surface of the ice, he is detached
from the barbless hook with a dextrous jerk, and almost instantly
freezes solid. The elastic whalebone line is thrown off the stick
without kinking and let down again through the hole. When fish are
plentiful, they are caught as fast as they can be hauled up, sometimes
one on each “jigger.” If the fisherman finds no fish at the first hole
he moves to another part of the field and tries again until he succeeds
in “striking a school.” The fish vary in abundance on different days,
being sometimes so plentiful that I have known two or three children to
catch a bushel in a few hours, while some days very few are to be taken.
In addition to the polar cod, a&nbsp;few sculpins are also caught, and
occasionally the two species of Lycodes (L.&nbsp;turnerii and coccineus)
which voracious fish sometimes seize the little polar cod struggling on
the “jigger” and are thus caught themselves. This fishery is chiefly
carried on by the women, children, and old men, who go out in parties of
five or six, though the hunters sometimes go fishing when they have
nothing else to do. There were generally thirty or forty people out at
the fishing-ground every day in 1882.</p>

<p>Jiggers of this pattern appear to be used at Pitlekaj, from
Nordendskiöld’s description<a class = "tag" name = "tag388" id =
"tag388" href = "#note388">388</a>, but I have seen no account either
there or elsewhere
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page284" id = "page284">
284</a></span>
of the peculiar method of reeling up the line such as we saw at Point
Barrow. Lines of whalebone are very common among the Eskimo generally,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag389" id = "tag389" href = "#note389">389</a>
and perhaps this material is preferable to any other for fishing in this
cold region, for not only does the elastic whalebone prevent kinking,
but the ice which forms instantly on the wet line in winter does not
adhere to it, but can easily be shaken off. No. 56545 [410] is a line 51
feet and 10 inches long and 0.05 inch in diameter, made of human hair,
neatly braided in a round braid with four strands. This was called a
fishing line, but was the only one of the kind seen. Fishhooks of the
kind described, with a body of bone or ivory, which serves for a lure,
armed with a spur or bent hook of metal, without a barb, seem to be the
prevailing type amongst the Eskimo. In the region about Norton Sound
(as&nbsp;shown by the extensive collections of Mr. Nelson and others)
this is often converted into an elaborate lure by attaching pendants of
beads, bits of the red beak of the puffin, etc. Crantz mentions a
similar custom in Greenland of baiting a hook with beads.<a class =

<p>The most important fishery at the rivers is carried on by means of
gill-nets, set under the ice, and visited every few days. In these are
taken large numbers of all three species of whitefish (Coregonus
kenicotti, C.&nbsp;nelsoni, and C.&nbsp;laurettæ.) The collection
contains three specimens of these nets, two of whalebone and one of
sinew. No. 56754 [147], Fig. 275, is a typical whalebone net. It is long
and shallow, 79 meshes long and 21 deep, made of fine strips of
whalebone fastened together as in the whalebone fishing lines. Most of
the whalebone is black, but a few light colored strips are intermixed at
random. The length of the mesh is 3¼ inches, and the knot used in making
them is the ordinary netting-knot. When not in use the net is rolled up
into a compact ball and tied up with a bit of string. When set, this net
is 21 feet 7 inches long and 3 feet 4 inches deep. The other whalebone
net (No.&nbsp;56753 [172], also from Utkiavwĭñ), is similar to this, but
slightly larger, being 87 meshes (25&nbsp;feet) long and 22 (3&nbsp;feet
9 inches) deep. The length of mesh is 3½ inches.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page285" id = "page285">

Fig. 276 (unit of web) is a net (No.&nbsp;56752 [171] from the same
village) of the same mesh and depth, but 284 meshes (60&nbsp;feet) long
and made of twisted sinew twine.</p>

<p>I had no opportunity of seeing the method of setting these nets under
the ice, but it is probably the same as that used in setting the seal
nets. When in camp at Pernyû in the summer, the natives set these nets
in the shoal water of Elson Bay, at right angles to the beach, with a
stake at each end of the net. They are set by a man in a kayak, and in
them are gilled considerable numbers of whitefish, two species of salmon
(Oncorhynchus gorbuscha and O.&nbsp;nerka) and an occasional trout
(Salvelinus malma). They take these nets east with them on their summer
expeditions, but we did not learn the method of using them at this
season. Perhaps they are sometimes used for seining on the beach, as
Thomas Simpson says that the Eskimo at Herschel Island (probably
Kûñmûd´lĭñ) sold his party “some fine salmon trout, taken in a seine of
whalebone, which they dragged ashore by means of several slender poles
spliced together to a great length.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag391" id

<p>An Utkiavwĭñ native told us that he found trout (Salvelinus malma) so
plentiful at or near the mouth of the Colville, in 1882, that he fed his
dogs with them.</p>

<p>Fig. 277 is a peculiar net or fish-trap (No. 56755 [190]) from
Utkiavwĭñ, the only specimen of the kind seen. It is a conical,
wide-mouthed bag, 8&nbsp;feet 4 inches long and 5½ feet wide at the
mouth, netted all in one piece of twisted sinew, with a 2¼-inch mesh.
This was brought over for sale at an early date, before we were well
acquainted with the natives, and we only learned that it was set
permanently for catching fish. Unfortunately, we never saw another
specimen, and through the press of other duties never happened to make
further
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page286" id = "page286">
286</a></span>
inquiries about it. From its shape it would appear as if it were meant
to be set in a stream with the mouth towards the current. This
contrivance is called sápotĭn, which corresponds to the Greenlandic
saputit, a&nbsp;dam for catching fish.</p>

<p>From all accounts, the natives east of the Anderson River region were
ignorant of the use of the net before they made the acquaintance of the
whites,<a class = "tag" name = "tag392" id = "tag392" href =
"#note392">392</a> though they now use it in several places, as in
Greenland and Labrador. The earliest explorers on the northwest coast,
however, found both fish and seal nets in use, though, as I have already
mentioned, the seal net was spoken of at Point Barrow as a comparatively
recent invention. At the present day, nets are used all along the coast
from the Mackenzie and Anderson rivers (see MacFarlane’s Collection) as
far south at least as the Yukon delta.<a class = "tag" name = "tag393"
id = "tag393" href = "#note393">393</a> I&nbsp;have not been able to

Petroff<a class = "tag" name = "tag394" id = "tag394" href =

ourselves at Plover Bay, and Nordenskiöld<a class = "tag" name =
"tag396" id = "tag396" href = "#note396">396</a> describes the nets used
at Pitlekaj, which are made of sinew thread. It is almost certain that
the American Eskimo learned the use of the net from the Siberians, as
they did the habit of smoking, since the use of the gill net appears to
have been limited to precisely the same region as the Siberian form of
tobacco pipe.<a class = "tag" name = "tag397" id = "tag397" href =

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "fishing_spears" id = "fishing_spears" href

<p>The only evidence which we have of the use of spears for catching
fish in this region is a single specimen, No. 89901 [1227], Fig. 278,
from Utkiavwĭñ, which was newly and rather carelessly made for sale, but
intended, as we were told, for spearing fish. This has a roughly
whittled shaft, of spruce, 21½ inches long, armed at one end with three
prongs. The middle prong is of whalebone, 4⅓ inches long, inserted into
the tip of the shaft, which is cut into a short neck and whipped with
sinew. The side prongs are also of bone, 9&nbsp;inches long. Through the
tip of each is driven a sharp, slender slightly recurved spur of bone,
about 1½ inches long. Each prong is fastened to the shaft with two small
wooden treenails, and they are braced with a figure-of-eight lashing of
sinew through holes in the side prongs and around the middle one. The
side prongs are somewhat elastic, so that when the spear is struck down
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page287" id = "page287">
287</a></span>
on the back of a fish they spring apart and allow the middle prong to
pierce him, and then spring back so that the spurs either catch in his
sides or meet below his belly, precisely on the principle of the “patent
eel spear.” This implement is almost identical with one in the National
Museum from Hudson Bay, which appears to be in general use among the
eastern Eskimo.<a class = "tag" name = "tag398" id = "tag398" href =
"#note398">398</a> The name, kăki´bua, is very nearly the same as that
used by the eastern natives (kākkĭe-wĕi, Parry, and kakívak, Kumlien).
This spear is admirably adapted for catching large fish in shallow rocky
streams where a net can not be used, or where they are caught by dams in
tidal streams in the manner described by Egede and Crantz. There is so
little tide, however, on the northwest coast, that this method of
fishing can not be practiced, and, as far as I know, there is no
locality in the range of the Point Barrow natives, a&nbsp;region of open
shoal beaches, and rivers free of rocks, where this spear could be used
in which a net would not serve the purpose much better. Taking into
consideration the scarcity of these spears and the general use of nets,
I&nbsp;am inclined to believe that this spear is an ancient weapon,
formerly in general use, but driven out of fashion by the introduction
of nets.</p>


<h4><a name = "flint" id = "flint" href = "#top">FLINT WORKING.</a></h4>

<p>These people still retain the art of making flint arrow and
spearheads, and other implements such as the blades for the skin
scrapers to be hereafter described. Many of the flint arrowheads and
spear points already described were made at Nuwŭk or Utkiavwĭñ
especially for sale to us and are as finely formed and neatly finished
as any of the ancient ones. The flints, in many cases water-worn
pebbles, appear to have been splintered by percussion into fragments of
suitable sizes, and these sharp-edged spalls are flaked into shape by
means of a little instrument consisting of a short, straight rod of some
hard material mounted in a short curved haft. We collected nine of these
tools (kĭ´gli) of which two have no blades. No. 89262 [1223] figured in
Point Barrow Report, Ethnology, Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">III</span>, Fig. 7, has been selected as the type. The
handle is of walrus ivory, 7.8 inches long, straight and nearly
cylindrical for about 4½ inches, then bending down like a saw handle and
spread out into a spatulate butt. Fitted into a deep groove on the top
of the handle so that its tip projects 1.8 inches beyond the tip of the
latter is a slender four-sided rod of whale’s bone, 4.7 inches long.
This is held in place by two simple lashings, one of cotton twine and
the other of seal thong. The flint to be flaked is held in the left hand
and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page288" id = "page288">
288</a></span>
pressed against the fleshy part of the palm which serves as a cushion
and is protected by wearing a thick deer-skin mitten. The tool is firmly
grasped well forward in the right hand with the thumb on top of the
blade and by pressing the point steadily on the edge of the flint,
flakes of the desired size are made to fly off from the under
surface.</p>

<p>These tools vary little in pattern, but are made of different
materials. Hard bone appears to have been the commonest material for the
blade, as three out of the seven blades are of this substance. One
specimen (No.&nbsp;89263 [796] from Utkiavwĭñ) has a blade of iron of
the same shape but only 2 inches long. No. 89264 [1001] also from
Utkiavwĭñ, Fig. 279<i>a</i>, has a short blade of black flint flaked
into a four-sided rod 1½ inches long. This is held in place by a
whipping of stout seal thong tightened by thrusting a splinter of wood
in at the back of the groove.</p>

both from Utkiavwĭñ) have blades of the peculiar Nuɐsuknan concretions
previously described. Each is an oblong pebble wedged into the groove
and secured by a lashing as usual. No. 89260 [794] has a haft of antler.
This is rather the commonest material for the haft. Two specimens have
hafts of walrus ivory and three of fossil ivory. The length of the haft
is from 6 to 8 inches, of the blade 1.5 to 4.7 inches. Fig. 280
(No.&nbsp;89265 [979] from Nuwŭk) is the haft of one of these tools,
made of fossil ivory, yellow from age and stained brown in blotches,
which shows the way in which the groove for the blade was excavated,
namely, by boring a series of large round holes and cutting away the
material between them. The remains of the holes are still to be seen in
the bottom of the groove. The tip of this haft has been roughly carved
into a bear’s head with the eyes and nostrils incised and filled with
black dirt, and the eyes, nostrils, and mouth of a human face have been
rudely incised on the under side of the butt and also blackened. All
this carving is new and was done with the view of increasing the market
value of the object. The original ornamentation consists of an incised
pattern on the upper surface of the butt, colored with red ocher which
has turned black from age and dirt.</p>

<p>Fig. 281 (No. 89782 [1004<i>e</i>]) is one of these tools, very
neatly made, with a haft of reindeer antler and a bone blade, secured by
a whipping of seal thong which belongs with the “kit” of tools owned by
the “inland” native, Ilû´bw’ga. Mr. Nelson collected a number of
specimens of this tool at various points on the northwest coast from
Point Hope as far south as Norton Bay, but I can find no evidence of its
use elsewhere.</p>

<p>In former times fire was obtained in the method common to so many
savages, from the heat developed by the friction of the end of a stick
worked like a drill against a piece of soft wood. This instrument was
still in use at least as late as 1837,<a class = "tag" name = "tag399"

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 282.&mdash;Fire drill with
mouthpiece and stock.</p>

<p>A native of Nuwŭk one day brought down for sale what he said was an
exact model of the ancient fire drill, nióotĭñ. This is No. 89822
[1080], Fig. 282. The drill is a stick of pine 12 inches long, shaped
like the shaft of a common perforating drill, brought to a blunt but
rounded point. This is worked by a string, without bow or handles,
consisting of a strip of the skin of the bearded seal, 40 inches long,
and has for a mouthpiece the astragalus bone of a reindeer, the natural
hollow on one side serving as a socket for the butt of the drill.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag401" id = "tag401" href = "#note401">401</a>
The point of the drill
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page290" id = "page290">
290</a></span>
is made to work against the split surface of a stick of spruce 18 inches
long, along the middle of which is cut a gash, to give the drill a
start. Three equidistant circular pits, charred and blackened, were
bored out by the tip of the drill, which developed heat enough to set
fire to the sawdust produced. Tinder was probably used to catch and hold
the fire.</p>

<p>Most authors who have treated of the Eskimo have described an
instrument of this sort in use either in former times or at the present
day.<a class = "tag" name = "tag402" id = "tag402" href =
"#note402">402</a></p>

<p>Among most Eskimo, however, a bow is used to work the drill. The only
exceptions to this rule appears to have been the ancient Greenlanders
and the people of Hudson Bay (see the passages from Hakluyt, Crantz, and
Ellis, just quoted.) Chamisso, however,<a class = "tag" name = "tag403"
id = "tag403" href = "#note403">403</a> speaks of seeing the Aleutians
at Unalaska produce fire by means of a stick worked by a string making
two turns about the stick and held and drawn with both hands, with the
upper end of the stick turning in a piece of wood held in the mouth.
When a piece of fir was turned against another piece of the same wood
fire was often produced in a few seconds. This passage appears to have
escaped the usually keen observation of Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Dall, who,
speaking of the ancient Aleutians, says: “The ‘fiddle-bow drill’ was an
instrument largely used in their carving and working bone and ivory; but
for obtaining fire but two pieces of quarz were struck together,” etc.<a

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page291" id = "page291">

<p>I had no opportunity of seeing this drill manipulated, but I have
convinced myself by experiment that the stick or “light-stock,” to use
Nordenskiöld’s expression, must be held down by one foot, the workman
kneeling on the other knee.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "fire_flint" id = "fire_flint" href =
"#fire">Flint and steel.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>Fire is usually obtained nowadays by striking a spark in the ordinary
method from a bit of flint with a steel, usually a bit of some white
man’s tool. Both are carried, as in Dr. Simpson’s time, in a little bag
slung around the neck, along with some tinder made of the down of willow
catkins mixed with charcoal or perhaps gunpowder. The flints usually
carried for lighting the pipe, the only ones I have seen, are very
small, and only a tiny fragment of tinder is lighted which is placed on
the tobacco. Lucifer matches (kĭlĭăksagan) were eagerly begged, but they
did not appear to care enough for them to purchase them. Our friend
Nĭkawáalu, from whom we obtained much information about the ancient
customs of these people, told us that long ago, “when there was no iron
and no flint”&mdash;“savik píñmût, ánma píñmût”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag405" id = "tag405" href = "#note405">405</a>&mdash;they used to get
“great fire” by striking together two pieces of iron pyrites. Dr.
Simpson speaks<a class = "tag" name = "tag406" id = "tag406" href =
"#note406">406</a> of two lumps of iron pyrites being used for striking
fire, but he does not make it clear whether he saw this at Point Barrow
or only at Kotzebue Sound. Iron pyrites appears to have been used quite
generally among the Eskimo. Bessels saw it used with quartz at Smith
Sound, with willow catkins for tinder<a class = "tag" name = "tag407" id
= "tag407" href = "#note407">407</a> and Lyon mentions the use of two
pieces of the same material, with the same kind of tinder, at Iglulik.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag408" id = "tag408" href = "#note408">408</a>
Willow catkins are also used for tinder at the Coppermine River.<a class

<p>No. 89825 [1133 and 1722] are some of the catkins used for making the
tinder, which were gathered in considerable quantities at the rivers.
They are called kĭmmiuru, which perhaps means “little dogs,” as we say
“catkins” or “pussy willows.”</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "fire_kindlings" id = "fire_kindlings" href

<p>From the same place they also brought home willow twigs,
9&nbsp;inches long, and tied with sinews into bunches or fagots of about
a dozen or a dozen and a half each, which they said were used for
kindling fires. (No.&nbsp;89824 [1725].)</p>

<p>A complete set of bow-and-arrow tools consists of 4 pieces, viz:
a&nbsp;marline spike, two twisters, and a feather setter, as shown in
Fig. 283, No. 89465 [962], from Utkiavwĭñ. The pieces of this set are

<p>This implement is used in putting on the backing of a bow to raise
parts of the cord when an end is to be passed under and in tucking in
the ends in finishing off a whipping. It was probably also used in
putting whippings or seizings on any other implements. We collected 10
of these tools, all quite similar, and made of walrus ivory, yellow from
age and handling. They vary in length from 4½ to 6 inches, and are
always contracted at the upper end into a sort of neck or handle,
surmounted by a knob or crossbar. No. 89463 [836] Fig. 284, from
Utkiavwĭñ has the crossbar carved very neatly into the figure of an
Amphipod crustacean without the legs. The eyes, mouth, and vent are
indicated by small round holes filled with some black substance, and
there is a row of eight similar holes down the middle of the back. The
tip of this tool, which is 5.9 inches long, has been concaved to an edge
so as to make a feather-setter of it. Through the knob at the butt there
is sometimes a large round eye, as in Fig. 285 (No.&nbsp;89464 [842]
from Utkiavwĭñ, 4.7 inches long). These tools are sometimes plain, like
the specimens last figured, and sometimes ornamented with conventional
patterns of incised lines, colored with red ocher, like the others.</p>

<p> (No. 89465 [962]) are flat four-sided rods of walrus ivory,
respectively 4.4 and 4.7 inches long. At each end one broad face is
raised into a low transverse ridge about 0.1 inch high and the other
rounded off, with the ridge on opposite faces at the two ends. They are
ornamented on all four faces with longitudinal incised lines, colored
with red ocher.</p>

<p>The use of these tools, which was discovered by actual experiment
after our return to this country<a class = "tag" name = "tag410" id =
"tag410" href = "#note410">410</a> is for twisting the strands of the
sinew backing after it has been put on the bow into the cables already
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page293" id = "page293">
293</a></span>
described. The manner in which this tool is used is as follows: The end
is inserted between the strands at the middle of the bow, so that the
ridge or hook catches the lower strands, and the end is carried over
through an arc of 180°, which gives the cable a half turn of twist. This
brings the twister against the bow, so that the twisting can be carried
no further in this direction, and if the tool were to be removed for a
fresh start the strands would have to be held or fastened in some way,
making the process a slow one. Instead, the tool is slid back between
the strands till the other end comes where the first was, so that the
hook at this end catches the strand, and the workman can give to the
cable another half turn of twist. This is continued until the cable is
sufficiently twisted, the tool sliding back and forth like the handle of
a vise. The tools are used in pairs, one being inserted in each cable
and manipulated with each hand, so as to give the same amount of twist
to each cable. At the present day, these tools are seldom used for bow
making, since the sinew-backed bow is so nearly obsolete, but are
employed in playing a game of the nature of pitch-penny. (See below,
under games and pastimes.)</p>

<p>These tools, of which we collected twenty-six specimens, are all of
walrus ivory, and of almost exactly the same shape, varying a little in
size and ornamentation. They vary in length from 3 to 5.7 inches, but
are usually about 4½ inches long. The commonest width is 0.4 inches, the
narrowest being 0.3 and the <ins class = "correction" title =
"textreads ‘width’">widest</ins> 0.7 broad, while the thickness is almost
always 0.3, varying hardly 0.1 inch. Most of them are plain, but a few
are ornamented with incised lines, and two are marked with “circles and
dots” as in Fig. 286, one of a rather large pair (No.&nbsp;56521 [249]
from Utkiavwĭñ). These are 5.4 inches long, neatly made and quite clean.
All the others show signs of age and use.</p>

<p>There are large numbers of these tools in the National Museum from
various points in the region where bows of the Arctic type are used,
namely, from the Anderson River to Norton Sound, and one from St.
Lawrence Island, whence we have received no twisted bows. Their use was,
however, not definitely understood, as they are described simply as “bow
tools,” “bow string twisters” or even “arrow polishers.” Mr. Nelson
informs me that the tool is now not used in Norton Sound, except for
playing a game, as at Point Barrow, but that the natives told him that
they were formerly used for tightening the backing on a bow and also for
twisting the hard-laid sinew cord, which is quite as much, if not more,
used at Norton Sound as the braid so common at Point Barrow. I&nbsp;find
no mention of the use of this tool in any of the authors who have
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page294" id = "page294">
294</a></span>
treated of the Eskimo, except the following in Capt. Beechey’s
vocabulary, collected at Kotzebue Sound: “Marline spike, small of ivory,
for lacing bows&mdash;ke-poot-tak.” The specimens from the Mackenzie and
Anderson rivers are almost without exception made of hard bone, while
walrus ivory is the common material elsewhere. The name (kaputɐ) means
simply a “twister.”</p>

of walrus ivory, 7&nbsp;inches long, with the tip abruptly concaved to a
thin, rounded edge. The faces are ornamented with a pattern of straight
incised lines, colored with red ocher. This tool is used for squeezing
the small ends of the feathering into the wood of the arrow shaft close
to the nock. Fig. 287 is a similar tool (No.&nbsp;89486 [1285] from
Utkiavwĭñ) also of walrus ivory, 6&nbsp;inches long, with the upper end
roughly whittled to a sharp point. It is probably made of a broken seal
indicator or meat-cache marker. Several other ivory tools previously
mentioned have been concaved to an edge at the tip so that they can be
used as feather-setters. I&nbsp;do not find this tool mentioned by
previous observers, nor have I seen any specimens in the National
Museum.</p>

On this subject of using the feathers of birds of prey for arrows,
compare Crantz, History of Greenland, i, p.&nbsp;146, “the arrow
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. winged behind with a couple of raven’s feathers.”
Bessels, Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p.&nbsp;869 (the three arrows at
Ita had raven’s feathers). Parry, 2d Voyage, p.&nbsp;511, “Toward the
opposite end of the arrow are two feathers, generally of the spotted
owl, not very neatly lashed on;” and Kumlien, Contributions, p.&nbsp;37,
“The feather-vanes were nearly always made from the primaries of
<i>Strix scandiaca</i> or <i>Graculus carbo</i>.” The last is the only
mention I find of using any feathers except those of birds of prey.</p>

the Eskimo of “Meta Incognita” (Baffin Land) in 1577 he says: “They are
not made very fast, but lightly tyed to, or else set in a nocke, that
upon small occasion the arrowe leaveth these heads behind them.”</p>

This word appears to be a diminutive of the Greenlandic nuek&mdash;nuik,
now used only in the plural, nugfit, for the spear. These changes of
name may represent corresponding changes in the weapon in former times,
since, unless we may suppose that the bird dart was made small and
called the “little nuik,” and enlarged again after the meaning of the
name was forgotten, it is hard to see any sense in the present name,
“big little nuik.”</p>

Kumlien’s description (Contributions, p. 37, Cumberland Gulf) would
apply almost word for word to this spear, and Captain Parry, (Second
Voyage, p.&nbsp;509) describes a very similar one in use at Iglulik. The
“Perch, headed with two sharp-hooked Bones,” for spearing
salmon&mdash;called in the Grenlandsk Ordbog, kakiak, “en Lyster (med to
eller tre <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads‘Pigge”)’">Pigge)”</ins>&mdash;mentioned by Egede (Greenland,
p.&nbsp;108) is probably the same thing, and a similar spear is spoken
of by Rae (Narrative, p.&nbsp;172) as in use at Repulse Bay.
A&nbsp;similar weapon, described by Dr. Rink as “Mit einem in
brittischen Columbien vorkommenden identisch,” was found in east
Greenland (Deutsche Geographische Blätter, vol. 9, p.&nbsp;234). See the
description of the spear found by Schwatka at Back’s Great Fish River
(Nimrod in the North, p.&nbsp;139), also described by Klutschak (Als
Eskimo, etc., p.&nbsp;120).</p>

Bessels, Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p. 867, speaks of a fire drill used
at Smith Sound with a bow and a mouthpiece of ivory.</p>

<p class = "continue">A Greenlander; seen by John Davis, in 1586,
“beganne to kindle a fire, in his manner: he took a piece of a boord,
wherein was a hole halfe thorow: into that he puts the end of a roũd
sticke like unto a bedstaffe, wetting the end thereof in traine, and in
fashion of a turner, with a piece of lether, by his violent motion doth
very speedily produce fire.”&mdash;Hakluyt’s Voyages, etc. (1589),
p.&nbsp;782.</p>

<p class = "continue">“They take a short Block of dry Fir Tree, upon
which they rub another Piece of hard Wood, till by the continued Motion
the Fir catches Fire.”&mdash;Egede, Greenland, p.&nbsp;137.</p>

<p class = "continue">“If their fire goes out, they can kindle it again
by turning round a stick very quick with a string through a hole in a
piece of wood.”&mdash;Crantz, History of Greenland, vol. 1,
p.&nbsp;145.</p>

<p class = "continue">Lyon (Journal, p. 210) says that at Iglulik they
were able to procure “fire by the friction of a pin of wood in the hole
of another piece and pressed down like a drill from above.” This was
worked with a bow and willow catkins were used for tinder. A&nbsp;man
informed them that “he had learned it from his father rather for
amusement than for utility; the two lumps of iron pyrites certainly
answering the purpose a great deal better.”</p>

<p class = "continue">“They have a very dextrous Method of kindling
Fire; in order to which, they prepare two small Pieces of dry Wood,
which having made flat, they next make a small Hole in each, and having
fitted into these Holes a little cylindrical Piece of Wood, to which a
Thong is fastened, they whirl it about thereby with such a Velocity,
that by rubbing the Pieces of Wood one against the other, this Motion
soon sets them on fire.”&mdash;Ellis, Voyage to Hudsons Bay,
p.&nbsp;234.</p>

<p class = "continue">A picture of the process is given opposite page
132, in which a man holds the socket, while a woman works the thong
(western shore of Hudson Bay, near Chesterfield Inlet).</p>

<p class = "continue">Rae also mentions a similar drill used in the same
region in 1847 (Narrative, p.&nbsp;187); and there is a specimen in the
National Museum, collected by MacFarlane, and said to be the kind “in
use until lately” in the Mackenzie and Anderson region.</p>

<p class = "continue">Dall figures a fire drill with bow and mouthpiece
formerly in use at Norton Sound (Alaska, p.&nbsp;142); and Hooper
(Tents, etc., p.&nbsp;187) describes a similar drill at Plover Bay.</p>

<p class = "continue">From Nordenskiöld’s account (Vega, vol. 2, p. 121)
the fire drill seems to be still generally used by the natives at the
Vega’s winter quarters. He says that the women appeared more accustomed
to the use of the drill than the men, and that a little oil was put on
the end of the drill.</p>
