<p>For removing bits of flesh, fat, etc., from a “green” skin, and for
“breaking the grain” and removing the subcutaneous tissue from a dried
skin, the women, who appear to do most if not all of this work, use a
tool consisting of a blunt stone blade, mounted in a short, thick haft
of wood or ivory, fitting exactly to the inside of the hand and having
holes or hollows to receive the tips of the fingers and thumb. The skin
is laid upon the thigh and thoroughly scraped with
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page295" id = "page295">
295</a></span>
this tool, which is grasped firmly in the right hand and pushed from the
worker. This tool is also used for softening up skins which have become
stiffened from being wet and then dried. The teeth appear to be less
often used for such purposes than among the eastern Eskimo.</p>

</div>

<p>We obtained eighteen such scrapers, some without blades, and two
unmounted blades. Every woman owns one of these tools. While they are
all of the same general model, they vary a good deal in details. Four
different forms or subtypes have been recognized in the series
collected, all modifications of the form seen in Fig. 289, No. 89313
[955], which may be called the type. The blade is of brown jasper,
rather coarsely flaked, 1.1 inches long. It is wedged with pieces of
skin, into a deep slot in the tip of the handle, which is of fossil
ivory, slightly yellowed from handling. The left side against which the
thumb rests is slightly flattened, and the right slightly excavated to
receive the third and fourth fingers, which are bent round under the
lobe, their tips pressing against the concave under surface of the
latter. The fore and middle fingers rest upon the upper surface.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 290.&mdash;Skin
scrapers&mdash;handles only.</p>

<p>No. 89320 [1171] from Utkiavwĭñ, without a blade, is of the same
general pattern, but is slightly excavated on the left as well as the
right side so as to make a sort of shank. It is of fossil ivory, stained
a dingy orange from age and grease. The two incised circles and dots on
the upper surface close to the slot make the end of the handle look like
the head of a Lophius, which it is perhaps meant to represent. No. 89321
(858), an old fossil ivory handle, has the left side slightly hollowed
to receive the tip of the thumb, and a median keel on the upper surface
with a barely perceptible hollow on each side of it for the tips of the
fingers. This is a step toward the second subtype as shown in Fig. 290
(No.&nbsp;89317 [748] from Utkiavwĭñ, which has no blade). This is of
fossil ivory, thicker and more strongly arched than the type described,
deeply excavated below so as to form a broad lobe at the butt, with the
upper surface deeply grooved to receive the tips of the fore and middle
fingers, and a slight hollow on the left side for the thumb. This
specimen is very neatly made and polished, and all the edges are rounded
off. One-half of the handle (lengthwise) and the outer quarter of the
other half are stained with age and grease a beautiful amber
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page296" id = "page296">

brown. This specimen was said to be as old as the time when men wore but
one labret.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 291.&mdash;Skin scrapers.</p>

<p>The only essential difference between this subtype and the preceding
is that the former has deep grooves or hollows for the thumb and two
fingers. We collected five specimens of this pattern, all but one with
handles of fossil ivory. The single exception, which came from Sidaru,
has a handle of walrus ivory, yellowed with age and grease. This
specimen (Fig. 291<i>a</i>, No. 89322 [1426]) has an unusually short
blade (only 0.4 inch long), and is much cut out on the right side so as
to make a sort of nick. Fig. 291<i>b</i> (No.&nbsp;89314 [1780]) is a
nearly new handle of this pattern, which was bought of the
“Nunatañmiun,” who came to Pernyû in 1883. It is very highly ornamented,
both with incised patterns, colored black, and by carving the space
between the unusually deep thumb hollow and those for the fingers into
what seems to be meant for an ear, in high relief, colored red
inside.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 292.&mdash;Skin scraper.</p>
</div>

<p>The third subtype has the lobe separated from the body on the right
side only, leaving the left side unexcavated, except by the
thumb-hollow, as is shown in Fig. 292 (No.&nbsp;89316 [1177] from
Utkiavwĭñ) which has a handle of yellowed fossil ivory and a black flint
blade. No. 89310 [1071] Fig. 293, from Utkiavwĭñ, is a rather unusual
modification of this pattern, with a wooden handle, in which the bottom
is not cut out. The thumb groove is deepened into a large hole which
opens into the excavation on the right side, while a large oblong slot
on top, opening into these cavities, takes the place of the two finger
hollows. The blade was of gray flint and rather longer than usual.</p>

<p>The last subtype which, according to my recollection, is the one most
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page297" id = "page297">
297</a></span>
frequently seen in use at the present day, has the butt produced
horizontally into a broad, flat lobe. The excavation of the right side
may be continued through to the left in the form of a notch, as shown in
Fig. 294 (No.&nbsp;89315 [1365] from Sidaru) which has a blade of black
flint and a handle of fossil ivory, with hollows for the thumb and
fingers; or the left side may be unexcavated except for the thumb groove
as in Fig. 295 (No.&nbsp;89309 [1135] from Utkiavwĭñ). This specimen has
a rather large wooden handle, with the grooves as before. It appears,
however, to have been remodeled to fit a smaller hand than that of the
original owner, as the thumb groove has been deepened for about
two-thirds of its original length, and there is a deep, round hole in
the middle of the groove for the second finger. The peculiarity of this
specimen, however, is that it has a blade of sandstone, flat and rather
thin, with a smooth, rounded edge. The natives told us that scraper
blades of sandstone were the prevailing form in old times.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 296 (No. 89312 [1336] from Utkiavwĭñ) is another wooden handle,
in which the excavation for the third and fourth fingers is merely a
large round hole on the right side, while in front the handle is cut
into two short lobes, between which in a deep groove the forefinger
fits. There is a hollow for the thumb under the left lobe and one on the
right for the middle finger. No. 89311 [1079] from the same village is
almost exactly similar. These are the only two specimens of the kind
which I recollect seeing. A&nbsp;rather large flint-bladed scraper with
a wooden handle very much the shape of that of No. 89309 [1135] is the
tool most generally used at the present day. The blades are all of the
same general shape and vary in size from the little one above mentioned
(No.&nbsp;89322
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page298" id = "page298">
298</a></span>
[1426], Fig. 291<i>a</i>), only 0.4 inch long, to blades like No. 89612
[820], Fig. 297, from Utkiavwĭñ. This is newly made from light gray
translucent flint and is 5 inches long. The name kibûgû, applied to this
specimen by the native from whom it was purchased, appears to refer
either to the material or the unusual size. The blade is ordinarily
called kuki, “a&nbsp;claw.” With the ivory handles a blade about 1 or 1½
inches is commonly used and with the wooden ones a considerably larger
one, 2&nbsp;to 3 inches in length. The handles vary in size to fit the
hands of the owners, but are all too small for an average white man’s
hand. All that we collected are for the right hand.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 297.&mdash;Flint blade for skin
scraper.</p>
</div>

<p>This pattern of skin scraper which appears from the Museum
collections to be the prevailing one from Point Barrow to Norton Sound,
is evidently the direct descendant of the form used still farther south,
which consists of a stone or bone blade of the same shape, mounted on a
wooden handle often a foot or 18 inches long, which has the other end
bent down into a handle like the butt of a pistol. Shortening this
handle (a&nbsp;process shown by specimens in the Museum) would bring the
worker’s hand nearer to the blade, thus enabling him to guide it better.
Let this process be continued till the whole handle is short enough to
be grasped in the hand and we have the first subtype described, of which
the others are clearly improvements.</p>

<p>A still more primitive type of scraper is shown by Fig. 298, No.
89651 [1295] from Utkiavwĭñ, the only specimen of the kind seen. This
has a flint blade, like those of the modern scrapers, inserted in the
larger end of a straight haft of reindeer antler, 5½ inches long. We did
not learn the history of this tool in the hurry of trade, but from the
shape of the blade it is evidently a scraper. Its use as a skin scraper
is rendered still more probable by the fact that the scrapers used by
some of the eastern Eskimo (there are specimens in the Museum from
Cumberland Gulf and Pelly Bay) have straight handles, though shorter
than this.</p>

<p>The Siberian natives use an entirely different form of scraper which
has a long handle like that of a spoke-shave with a small blade of stone
or iron in the middle and is worked with both hands.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag411" id = "tag411" href = "#note411">411</a> Fig. 299
(No.&nbsp;89488 [1578] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a tool which we never saw in
use but which we were told was intended for scraping skins. It is
probably an obsolete tool, as a knife would better serve the purpose of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page299" id = "page299">
299</a></span>
removing the subcutaneous tissue, etc., while the stone scrapers just
described are better for softening the skin.</p>

<p>It is the distal end of the “cannon” bone or metacarpal, of a
reindeer, 6.2 inches long, with the two condyles forming the handle. At
the other end the posterior face of the shaft is chamfered off so as to
expose the medullary cavity for about 2½ inches, leaving a sharp edge on
each side. The tip is roughly broken off. The tool appears to be old but
the two condyles have been recently carved rudely into two human faces,
one male (with marks for labrets) and the other female. There is a
somewhat similar tool in the Museum brought by Mr. Nelson from Norton
Sound.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "skin_cups" id = "skin_cups" href =
"#skin">Scraper cups</a> (óhovwĭñ).&mdash;</h6>

<p>In removing the last of the blubber from the skins of seals or
walruses when they wish to save the oil, they scrape it off with a
little oblong cup of walrus ivory with a sharp edge at one or both ends.
The cup, of course, catches the oil which is transferred to a dish.
These cups are sometimes, I&nbsp;believe, also used for dipping oil. We
collected ten of these cups, of which No. 89251 [1287], Fig.
300<i>a</i>, will serve as the type. This is 3.7 inches long, carved out
of a single piece of walrus ivory, and worked down from the inside to a
sharp edge on each end. The carving is smoothly done on the outside, but
more roughly within, where it is somewhat hacked. It is stained a dark
yellow with oil and polished on the outside, probably by much handling.
Fig. 300<i>b</i> (No.&nbsp;89258 [1090] also from Utkiavwĭñ) is a
similar cup, but has a sharp edge only at one end which is cut out in a
concave curve.</p>

alt = "see caption"></p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 300.&mdash;Scraper cups.</p>

<p>The ten cups in the collection are all about the same shape and size
and all of walrus ivory, stained yellow with oil. The largest is 4
inches long and 2¾ wide, and the smallest, 3&nbsp;by 2.1 inches. The
majority are about 3½ by 2½ inches. Five of the ten have sharp edges at
both ends, the rest at one only. Mr. Nelson brought home specimens of
this implement from Point Hope and St. Lawrence Island, but I do not
find it mentioned elsewhere.</p>

<p>With these tools and their knives, they do all the work of preparing
skins for clothing, boat covers, etc. I&nbsp;had no opportunity of
seeing the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page300" id = "page300">
300</a></span>
process in all its stages, and can therefore give only a general account
of it. Deerskins are always dressed as furs, with the hair on. The skin
is rough-dried in the open air, with considerable subcutaneous tissue
adhering to it, and laid aside until needed. When wanted for use,
a&nbsp;woman takes the skin and works it over carefully with a stone
scraper on the flesh side, removing every scrap of subcutaneous tissue
and “breaking the grain” of the skin, which leaves a surface resembling
white chamois leather and very soft. This is then rubbed down with a
flat piece of sandstone or gypsum, and finally with chalk, so that when
finished it seems like pipeclayed leather. All furs are prepared in the
same way. Small seal skins to be worn with the hair on are scraped very
clean and, I&nbsp;think, soaked in urine, before they are spread out to
dry. The black waterproof seal skin has the hair shaved off close to the
skin, great care being taken to leave the epidermis intact, and also has
a certain amount of tanning in urine. It is probable that a little of
the blubber is left on these skins, to make them oily and
waterproof.</p>

<p>When, however they wish to prepare the white-tanned seal skin, the
skins are brought into the warm house, thawed out or dampened and then
rolled up and allowed to ferment for several days, so that when they are
unrolled hair and epidermis are easily scraped off together. The skin is
then soaked in urine, stretched on a large hoop, and put out to dry in
the sun and air. Many of these skins are prepared during the first sunny
weather in the early spring. The skins of the large seal, walrus or bear
when used for boat-covers or boot soles appear to be sweated in the same
way, as the epidermis is always removed. We did not learn whether urine
was employed on these skins, but I think from their ordinary appearance
that they are simply stretched and dried in their own fat, as appears to
be the case with the skin of the beluga, from which the epidermis is
easily scraped without sweating.<a class = "tag" name = "tag412" id =
"tag412" href = "#note412">412</a></p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "skin_combs" id = "skin_combs" href =
"#skin">Combs for deerskins.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>The loosened hairs on a deerskin garment are removed by means of a
comb made of a section of the beam of an antler, hollowed out and cut
into teeth on the end. This instrument probably serves also to remove
vermin, as its name “kúmotĭn” looks very much as if derived from kúmûk,
louse. I&nbsp;must say, however, that the natives whom I asked if
kúmotĭn had anything to do with kúmûk said it had not. When vermin get
troublesome in a garment, it is taken out on the tundra, away from the
houses, and beaten with rods like a carpet. Very old garments when much
infested with lice are taken out back of the village, cut into small
pieces, and burned. It is no uncommon sight in the spring to see an old
woman sitting out on the tundra, busy with her knife cutting up old
clothes.</p>

<p>We brought home nine of these combs, of which No. 89354 [1879], Fig.
301<i>a</i>, has been selected as the type. It is 4¼ inches long and has
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page301" id = "page301">
301</a></span>
sixteen teeth about 1 inch long. The small holes near the other end are
for a lanyard to hang it up by.</p>

<p class = "illustration"><a name = "fig301" id = "fig301"></a>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 301.&mdash;Combs for cleaning
deerskins.</p>

<p>Six of these combs have teeth at one end only, the other three at
both ends. These teeth are generally about fifteen in number, and 1 inch
or a little over long. No. 89781 [1005], a&nbsp;very small comb only 2.9
inches long, which belonged to the “inland” native Ilûbw’ga, has twenty
teeth 0.6 inch long. These combs are usually about 4 or 4½ inches long.
No. 89556 [1017], Fig. 301<i>b</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ is an unusually long
comb, 5.3 inches long, which is peculiar in being solid except at the
end which is cut into teeth.</p>

<p>Fig. 301<i>c</i> (No. 89359 [993]), from Utkiavwĭñ is a double-ended
comb, having ten teeth on one end and thirteen on the other. It is 4.1
inches long and made with considerable care, being ornamented with
incised rings colored with red ocher. This is a common implement at
Point Barrow, but seems unusual elsewhere. There is a single specimen
from the Diomedes in Mr. Nelson’s collection.</p>


<h4><a name = "thong" id = "thong" href = "#top">MANUFACTURE OF LINES OF
THONG.</a></h4>

<p>No tools are used for this purpose except a knife. I have seen a
small jackknife used for cutting the fine seal skin lines. The workman
takes a wet skin from which the hair and epidermis have been removed and
sits down cross-legged on the ground with somebody else to hold the skin
stretched for him. Then holding the knife vertically up with the edge
away from him, he starts at one corner of the skin and cuts a narrow
strip in one continuous piece, going round and round the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page302" id = "page302">
302</a></span>
skin, gathering and stretching the strip with the left hand. They do
this work quite rapidly and with great skill, cutting single lines
upward of 90 feet long and only one-eighth inch in diameter, almost
perfectly even. These fine lines of seal-skin thong, which serve a great
variety of purposes, are usually made when they are in the summer camps,
before the breaking up of the ice. They are dried by stretching them
between stakes 6 inches or a foot high, driven into the ground.</p>

<p>The stout thongs of the hide of the bearded seal, walrus, or beluga
are usually made in the winter and stretched to dry between posts of
whales’ bones set up in the village, about breast high. While they are
drying, the maker carefully trims and scrapes the edges with his knife,
so as to make an almost round line.<a class = "tag" name = "tag413" id =
"tag413" href = "#note413">413</a> The usual diameter is about 0.3 inch.
These lines are not always made with such care, being often merely flat
thongs. Fine deer-skin twine, or “babiche,” as it is called by the
voyageurs, for making the nettings of snow shoes, is made in the same
way. A&nbsp;deer skin is dampened, rolled up, and put up over the lamp
for a day or two to remove the hair by sweating, and then cut into a
single long piece of fine thong.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 302.&mdash;Double-slit splice for
rawhide lines.</p>
</div>

<p>All the men do not appear able to do this fine work. For instance,
our friend Mû´ñialu had the babiche for his new snowshoes made by his
house-mate, the younger Tuñazu. When it is desired to fasten together
two pieces of the stouter kinds of thong, what I have so often referred
to as the “double-slit splice” is generally employed. This is made as
follows: The two ends to be joined together are each slit lengthwise,
and one is passed through the slit in the other. The other end of this
piece is then passed through the slit in the first piece, and drawn
through so that the sides of each slit interlace like the loops of a
square knot (see diagrams, Fig. 302). The splice is often further
secured by a seizing of sinew braid. Most writers on the Eskimo have not
gone sufficiently into the details of their arts to describe their
methods of splicing. One writer,<a class = "tag" name = "tag414" id =
"tag414" href = "#note414">414</a> however, in describing some Eskimo
implements from East Greenland, describes and figures several splices
somewhat of this nature, and one in particular especially complicated by
crossing the sides of the slits and passing the end through several
times. This method of uniting thongs is probably very general among the
Eskimo and is also common enough among civilized people.</p>

<p>At the present day they are very glad to use white men’s picks and
shovels when they want to dig in the gravel or clean out the ice from
their houses. They, however, have mattocks and pickaxes
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page303" id = "page303">
303</a></span>
(síkla) of their own manufacture, which are still in use. These are
always single-pointed and have a bone or ivory head, mounted like an adz
head on a rather short haft. The haft, like those of the mauls and adzes
already described, is never fitted into the head, but always applied to
the under surface of the latter and held on by a lashing of thong.</p>

<p>The only complete implement of the kind which we obtained is No.
73574 [297], Fig. 303. The head is of whale’s rib, 17¾ inches long. The
butt is shouldered on the under surface to receive the haft and
roughened with crosscuts to prevent slipping, with two shallow rough
transverse notches on the upper surface for the lashings. The haft is of
pine, 24½ inches long. The lashing is of stout thong of bearded seal
hide, in two pieces, one of four turns passing through the hole, round
the front edge of the haft, over the lower notch in the head, and back
across the haft to the hole again. The ends are knotted together on top
of the head by becket-hitching one end into an eye in the other, made by
slitting it close to the tip and passing a bight of the standing part
through this slit. The other part is of seven turns, put on in the same
way, but crossing back of the haft, and started by looping one end round
the head and through the eye by means of an eye at the end made as
before.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page304" id = "page304">
304</a></span>
It is finished off by winding the end three or four times round these
turns, so as to tighten them up, and hitching it round two of them on
one side. This method of hafting differs in no essential respect from
that used on the mauls and adzes above described.</p>

<p>We have also two heads for such mattocks, which hardly differ from
the one described, except the No. 56494 [285] has the notches for the
lashings on the side of the head instead of on the upper surface. It is
16 inches long. The other, No. 89843 [1043], Fig. 304<i>a</i>, is a very
rude head made of an almost cylindrical piece of rib. This is a very old
tool, which from its oily condition has evidently been long laid away in
some blubber room at Utkiavwĭñ. It is 15.2 inches long.</p>

<p>These blunt-pointed mattocks are not so much used at present as picks
with a sharp point mounted in the same way, and specially adapted for
working in ice or hard frozen soil. I&nbsp;have, however, never seen
them used for cutting holes in the ice for fishing, which some authors
have supposed to be what they were meant for. Their shape makes them
very inconvenient for any such a purpose, except when the ice is very
thin.</p>

<p>The ice pick, like those carried on the butt of the spear, is under
any circumstances a more serviceable tool. These sharp pickax heads are
generally made of a walrus tusk, the natural shape of which requires
very little alteration to fit it for the purpose. We collected three of
these ivory heads, all very nearly alike, of which No. 56539<i>b</i>
[96], Fig. 304<i>b</i>, will serve as the type. This is the tip of a
good-sized walrus tusk, 14.2 inches long, preserving very nearly the
natural outline of the tusk except at the point, where it is rounded off
rather more abruptly above. It is keeled along the upper edge and on the
lower edge at the point, so that the latter is four-sided, and the sides
of the butt are flattened. On the under side the butt is cut off flat
for about 3½ inches, leaving a low flange or ridge, and roughened with
crosscuts to fit the end of the haft, and the butt is perforated with
two large <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads‘tranverse’">transverse</ins> eyes for the lashing. The other
two heads are almost exactly like this and very nearly the same size.</p>

<p>Sharp-pointed pick heads of whale’s bone appear also to have been
used, probably at an earlier date than the neatly finished ivory ones,
as we collected three such heads, all very old and roughly made, and
having notches or grooves for the lashings instead of eyes. Fig.
304<i>c</i> is one of these, No. 89844 [1315], from Utkiavwĭñ, very
rudely cut from a piece of whale’s rib, 12 inches long.</p>

<p>I do not recollect seeing any of these bone-headed picks in use,
while the ivory-headed one was one of the commonest tools. This Eskimo
tool is in use at Pitlekaj, a&nbsp;village supposed to be wholly
inhabited by sedentary Chukches.<a class = "tag" name = "tag415" id =

<p>The broad, short-handled snow shovel of wood with a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page306" id = "page306">
306</a></span>
sharp edge of ivory is the tool universally employed whenever snow is to
be shoveled, either to clear it away or for excavating houses or
pitfalls in the snowdrifts, or “chinking” up the crevices in the walls
of the snow house, and is an indispensable part of the traveler’s outfit
in winter. The shovels (pĭ´ksun) are all made on essentially the same
pattern, which is well shown by Fig. 306<i>a</i>, No. 56739 [30]. The
blade is 14 inches broad and 11 long. The whole upper surface of the
shovel is flat. The handle is beveled off on the side to a rounded edge
below, and is quite thick where it joins the blade, tapering off to the
tip. The blade is thick and abruptly rounded off on the upper edge below
and gradually thinned down to the edge. The edge of the wood is fitted
with a tongue into a <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads‘grove’">groove</ins> in the top of the ivory edge, which is 1½ inches
deep. It is fastened on by wooden tree-nails at irregular intervals, and
at one end, where the edge of the groove has been broken, by a stitch of
black whalebone. The wooden part of the shovel is made of four unequal
pieces of spruce, neatly fitted and doweled together and held by the
ivory edge and three stitches of black whalebone close to the upper
edge, and countersunk below the flat surface. The whippings of sinew
braid on the handle are to give a firm grip for the hands.</p>

<p>No. 56738 [27], Fig. 306<i>b</i>, is a similar shovel of the same
material and almost exactly the same dimensions, figured to show the way
it has been pieced together and mended. The maker of this shovel was
able to procure a broad piece of wood which only had to be pieced out
with a narrow strip on the left side, which is fastened on as before. It
was, however, not long enough to make the whole of the handle, which has
a piece 8½ inches long, neatly scarfed on at the end and secured by six
stout treenails of wood; three at each end of the joint, passing through
the thin part of the scarf into the thick, but not through the latter.
Nearly the whole handle was seized with sinew braid put on as before,
but much of this seizing is broken off. At the right side of the blade
the grain takes a twist, bringing it parallel to the ivory edge, and
rendering it liable to split, as has happened from the warping of the
ivory since the shovel has been in the Museum. The owner sought to
prevent this by fastening to the edge a stout “strap” of walrus ivory 4½
inches, which appears to be an old bird spear point. The lower end of
this fitted into the groove of the ivory edge, and it was held on by
three equidistant lashings of narrow whalebone, each running through a
hole in the edge of the wood and round the ivory in a deep transverse
groove.</p>

<p>This pattern of snow shovel is very like that from Iglulik, figured
by Capt. Lyon,<a class = "tag" name = "tag416" id = "tag416" href =
"#note416">416</a> but the handle of the latter is so much shorter in
proportion to the blade that there is an additional handle like that of
a pot lid near the head of the blade on the upper surface. The ivory
edge also appears to be fastened on wholly with stitches.</p>

307</a></span>
<p>Fig. 307 (No. 89775 [1250] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a peculiar implement,
the only one of the kind that we saw. It is a shovel, 17 inches long,
made of a whale’s scapula, with the anterior and posterior borders cut
off straight so as to make it 13¼ inches broad, and the superior margin
beveled off to an edge. The handle is made by flattening the neck of the
scapula and cutting through it a large horizontal elliptical slot, below
which the end of the scapula is worked into a rounded bar 1 inch in
diameter. The cutting around this slot appears new, and red ocher has
been rubbed into the crevices. On the other hand, the beveling of the
digging edge appeared to be old. Though colored with red ocher, the edge
is gapped as if from use, and there are fragments of tundra moss
sticking to it. It is probably an old implement “touched up” for sale.
We did not learn whether such tools were now generally used. This may
have been a makeshift or an individual fancy.</p>

<p>The ivory ice pick (tu´u) always attached to the seal-harpoon has
been already described. This differs from the <i>tôk</i> of the
Greenlanders and other eastern Eskimo in having a sharp bayonet point,
while the latter is often chisel-pointed. All the men now have iron ice
picks which they use for cutting the holes for fishing, setting seal
nets, and such purposes. These are made of some white man’s tool which
has a socket, like a harpoon iron, a&nbsp;whale lance, a&nbsp;boarding
knife or bayonet, and usually have a rather slender blade about a foot
long, mounted on a pole 6 or 8 feet long. The point is sharp and
polygonal, generally four-sided. The tool is managed with both hands and
used to split off fragments of ice by rather oblique blows. In other
words, it is used in precisely the same way as the little single-handed
pick which we use in refrigerators. For chiseling off projecting corners
of ice when making a path out through the ice pack, they
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page308" id = "page308">
308</a></span>
often use whale spades, of which they have obtained a great many from
wrecks.</p>

<p>No. 89483 [1313] from Utkiavwĭñ, is a very old pick made of a piece
of reindeer antler, 11¼ inches long, split lengthwise, and tapered to a
sharp curved point. The butt is cut into a sort of tang with a low
shoulder. The split face is concave, the soft interior tissue having
been removed by decay and perhaps also intentionally. Another peculiar
tool is shown in Fig. 309 (No.&nbsp;89479 [1064] from Utkiavwĭñ). This
was called kăkaiyaxion, and is a rounded piece of antler 10.4 inches
long, tapering from the butt where there is a low shoulder and the
broken remains of a rounded tang to be fitted to a shaft. One side is
cut off flat from the shoulder to the tip, gradually becoming concave.
The concavity is deepest near the middle. The tip is slightly expanded,
rounded, and somewhat bent toward the convex side. The specimen is
smoothly and neatly made and dark brown from age. No other specimens
were seen. We were told that this tool was mounted on a long pole and
used for drilling holes in the ice by making the pole revolve with the
hands.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "snow_scoops" id = "snow_scoops" href =

<p>When picking a hole through the ice they use a long-handled scoop,
made of a piece of antler bent round into a hoop, and netted across the
bottom with strips of whalebone, so that the water may drain off in
dipping pieces of ice out of the water. We brought home one specimen of
this universal implement (No.&nbsp;89903 [1696], Fig. 310). The handle
is of oak, 5&nbsp;feet 1¾ inches long and elliptical in section. The rim
of the bowl is a long thin strip of antler, apparently from the “palm,”
bent round into a pointed oval, 8½ inches long and 5¾ wide, with the
ends of the strip overlapping about 3 inches at the broader end. The
ends are sewed together with two vertical stitches of whalebone.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page309" id = "page309">
309</a></span>
The left end has been broken across obliquely near the joint and mended
with whalebone stitches. Round the lower edge of the rim runs a row of
twenty-seven pairs of small holes 0.2 inch from the edge. The holes of
each pair are connected by a deep channel, and a narrow shallow groove,
probably for ornament, joins the pairs. On the left side are eight extra
holes between the pairs, which are not used. Through these holes,
omitting the first two pairs in the right-hand end, is laced a piece of
seal thong, thus: Starting at the point of the oval, the two ends of the
thong are passed through the pair of holes there from the outside and
the bight drawn home into the channel; the ends are crossed, the left
end going to the right, and vice versa, and passed out through the
farther hole of the next pair and in through the nearer, and so on till
the ends meet at the broad end of the oval where they are tied together,
thus making twenty-five loops on the inside of the rim into which the
netting is fastened. This is made of strips of thin whalebone,
interwoven, over and under each other, passing up through one loop and
down through the next. There are eleven longitudinal strands passing
obliquely from right to left, the same number from left to right, and
eleven transverse strands, making a network with elongated hexagonal
apertures. The strips are not one continuous piece. The bowl thus made
is fastened to the handle by three pieces of stout seal thong. The whole
lashing was put on wet, and allowed to shrink.</p>

<p>Nordenskiöld mentions and figures a scoop of almost identically the
same pattern, but smaller, in general use for the same purposes at
Pitlekaj.<a class = "tag" name = "tag417" id = "tag417" href =
"#note417">417</a> A&nbsp;smaller scoop or skimmer (ĕlauatĭn) is also
universally used. We inadvertently neglected to preserve a specimen of
this very common implement, though we had two or three about the station
for our own use. I&nbsp;shall therefore have to describe it from memory.
The handle is a flat, straight stick with rounded edges, about 18 inches
or 2 feet long, 1½ inches broad, and three-fourths inch thick. The bowl
is made of two pieces of antler “palm” of such a shape that when they
are fastened together on the end of the stick they make a shallow cup
about 3½ inches long by 3 wide, with a longitudinal crevice along the
middle which allows the water to drain off. The tip of the handle is
beveled off on both sides so as to fit into the inside of this cup,
along the junction of the two pieces, each of which is fastened to it by
one or two neat stitches of whalebone. The two pieces are fastened
together in front of the handle with a stitch.</p>

<p>In addition to the use of these scoops for skimming the fishing
holes, and reeling up the line, as already described, they also serve as
scrapers to remove snow and hoar frost from the clothing. In the winter
most of the men and boys, <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads‘epecially’">especially</ins> the latter, carry these skimmers whenever
they go out doors, partly for the sake of having something in their
hands, as we carry sticks, and partly for use. The boys are very fond of
using them to pick up and sling snowballs, bits of ice, or frozen dirt,
which they do with considerable force and accuracy.</p>

<p>For catching hold of pieces of blubber or flesh when “cutting in”
a&nbsp;whale or walrus, or dragging them round on shore or on the ice,
or in the blubber rooms, they use hooks made by fastening a
backward-pointing prong of ivory on the end of a wooden handle, which is
bent into a crook at the other end. Those specially intended for use in
the boats have handles 7 or 8 feet long, while those for shore use are
only 2 or 3 feet long. These implements, which are common all along the
Alaskan coast, may sometimes be used as boathooks, as appears to be the
case farther south, though I never saw them so employed. We brought home
two short hooks and one long one, No. 56766 [126], Fig. 311. This has a
prong of walrus ivory fastened to a spruce pole, 7&nbsp;feet 7¾ inches
long, to the other end of which is fastened a short crook of antler. The
pole is elliptical in section. The crook is a nearly straight “branch”
of an antler with a transverse arm at the base made by cutting out a
piece of the “beam” to fit against the pole, and is held on by three
neat lashings of whalebone of the usual pattern. The upper two of these
are transverse lashings passing through corresponding holes in the pole
and crook. The lowest, which is at the tip of the arm, is at right
angles to these, passing through wood and antler. The lashing of
whalebone close to the tip of the crook, passing through a hole and
round the under side of the latter, is to keep the hand from slipping
off. The prong is held on by two lashings of small seal thong, each
passing through a large transverse hole in the prong and a corresponding
one in the pole. The upper pair of holes do not exactly match. There are
also two unused holes, one in the pole below the upper hole and one
above the upper hole in the prong. These holes and the new appearance of
the lashings indicate that the prong is part of another hook recently
fitted to this pole. The two lashings are made by a single piece of
thong.

<p>We had no opportunity of seeing the process of twisting the sinew
twine, which is sometimes used in place of the braid so often mentioned
but more generally when an extra strong thread is desired, as in sewing
on boot soles. Fig. 314 (No.&nbsp;89431 [1332] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a
little shuttle of walrus ivory, 3&nbsp;inches long and 1⅓ broad, which
we were told was used in this process. The body of this shuttle is
reduced to a narrow crosspiece, and the prongs at one end are twice as
long as those at the other. The tips of the long prongs are about ¼ inch
apart, while those of the short ones nearly meet. There is a small round
hole in one side of the body. This specimen was made for sale. As well
as I could understand the seller, the ends of several strands of fine
sinew were fastened into the hole in the shuttle and twisted by twisting
it with one hand, while the other end was held perhaps by the other
hand. The part twisted was then wound on the shuttle and a fresh length
twisted. This would be a very simple form of spinning with a
spindle.</p>

<p>No special implements for twisting have been described among other
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page312" id = "page312">

Eskimo. Mr. E.&nbsp;W. Nelson (in&nbsp;a letter to the writer) says that
the natives of Norton Sound informed him that the cable twisters
(kaputa&mdash;kíbu´tûk at Norton Sound) were also used for making
twisted cord. He describes their use as follows: “The ends of the sinew
cord are tied to the center holes in the two ivory pieces, one of the
latter at each end of the cord, and then they are twisted in opposite
directions, thus getting the hard-laid sinew cord used on the bows.”</p>

<p>The sinew twine used at Point Barrow is generally braided, almost
always in a three-ply braid, usually about the size of stout packthread,
such as is found on many Eskimo implements from all localities
represented in the Museum collections. That they also know how to braid
with four strands is shown by the hair line already described
(No.&nbsp;56545 [410]). They also have a special word (which I can not
recall) for braiding with four strands in distinction from braiding with
three (pidrá).</p>

<p>Two implements are used as usual in netting, a&nbsp;needle or long
flat shuttle for carrying the twine (Fig. 315, No. 56570 [101]), and a
mesh stick for gauging the length of the mesh. The knot is the universal
“fisherman’s knot” or becket hitch made in the usual manner. The method
of using the mesh stick, however, is rather peculiar, and somewhat
clumsy compared with that used by civilized net-makers, as it serves
only to measure the mesh and not also to hold the successive meshes as
they are made. It is a long flat piece of bone or antler, shaped like a
case knife, with a blade square at heel and point. There is often also a
little blunt hook (as&nbsp;in Fig. 316, No. 56581 [1021]) at the point,
bending upward or toward the back of the blade. The blade is the part of
the stick which measures the mesh, and its length from heel to point is
always precisely half the length of the mesh to be made. It is used as
follows: The workman, holding the mesh stick by the handle in his left
hand, with the blade downward, catches the mesh into which the knot is
to be made with the hook, and holds it while the twine is carried down
the left side of the blade, round the heel and through the mesh as
usual, and drawn up till the preceding knot comes just to the point of
the blade. This makes a loop of the proper length for a mesh round the
stick. The point where the next knot is to be made is now caught between
the thumb and finger of the right hand and the mesh stick taken out of
the loop. The left thumb and finger, while the other fingers of this
hand still hold the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page313" id = "page313">

handle of the stick, relieve the fingers of the right hand, which goes
on to make the knot in the usual manner.<a class = "tag" name = "tag418"

<p>We collected thirteen needles of different patterns and sizes. No.
56570 [101], Fig. 315, has been selected as the type (ĭ´nmuvwĭñ,
mû´kutĭn.) It is of walrus ivory, 11.9 inches long. The small hole near
the tip of one prong is for a lanyard to hang it up by when not in use.
This needle could be used only for making a large meshed net, perhaps a
seal net.</p>

<p>We collected seven needles of almost the same pattern as this,
varying a little in proportions. The faces are usually more deeply
hollowed out and the ends usually sinuate instead of being straight.
Three of these are of reindeer antler and the rest of ivory. The longest
is 9.9 inches long and the shortest 4½. This needle (No.&nbsp;56574
[24], from Utkiavwĭñ) is rather broad in proportion, being nearly 1 inch
wide. It is of walrus ivory. No. 89433 [942] is better suited for
netting a small mesh, being only 0.7 inch broad at the widest part. It
is made of reindeer antler and is 7.3 inches long. These needles
sometimes have a small hole through one end of the body for fastening
the end of the twine, and most have some arrangement for fastening on a
lanyard, either a hole as in the type or a groove round the tip of one
prong as in No. 56574 [24].</p>

<p>No. 89427 [1283], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a needle of a slightly different
pattern, being rather thick and not narrowed at the middle. It is of
reindeer antler, 8.7 inches long and 1 wide. No. 89430 [1286], Fig.
317<i>a</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ, is a very broad needle, with short body and
long prongs, one of which is expanded at the tip and perforated for a
lanyard. It is a piece of the outside hard tissue of a reindeer antler,
5.4 inches long and 1.2 broad. It is but slightly narrowed at the
middle, while No. 89428 [1381], Fig. 317<i>b</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ,
a&nbsp;somewhat similar broad needle of the same material is deeply
notched on each side of the body. This is made from antler of smaller
diameter than the preceding, and consequently
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page314" id = "page314">

is not flat, but strongly convex, on one face and correspondingly
concave on the other. It is 8.2 inches long and 1½ wide.</p>

<p>For making the seal nets a very large needle is used. The one in the
collection, No. 56581 [102], Fig. 318, from Utkiavwĭñ, is 20½ inches
long and only 1½ wide. It is made of two nearly equal pieces of antler,
which are nearly flat, and lap over each other about 3¾ inches near the
middle. They are strongly fastened together by five whalebone stitches,
one at each corner of the splice and one in the middle. The corner
stitches run round the edge of the two parts, and through a hole through
both parts. The prongs are stout and curved, nearly meeting at the tips.
They are about 3 inches long. The lateral distortion appears to be due
to warping.</p>

<p>A peculiar netting needle is shown in Fig. 319 (No. 89429 [1333],
from Utkiavwĭñ), which is new and rather carelessly made from very
coarse walrus ivory. The tips of the prongs, after nearly meeting,
diverge again in the form of the letter U.&nbsp;This needle, which is 9½
inches long, was said by the maker to be of the pattern used by the
“Kûñmû´d’lĭñ.” There are no specimens resembling it in the museum
collections, though it curiously suggests certain implements from Norton
Sound, labeled “reels for holding fine cord,” consisting of slender rods
of antler, terminating at each end in similar shallow U-shaped
forks.</p>

<p>The mesh stick (kú´brĭn) belonging to the large netting needle, No.
56581 [102], may be taken as the type of this implement. It is a piece
of the hard outside tissue of a reindeer antler. The three notches on
the lower edge of the haft are for the fingers. The incised line along
one face of the blade is probably a mark to which the twine is to be
drawn in making a mesh. The blade is just the proper length, 7½ inches,
for the large mesh of the seal net. The remaining four mesh sticks are
all small, and intended for making fish nets. Three are of reindeer
antler and the fourth of hard bone, with a wooden haft.</p>

<p>Fig. 320<i>a</i> (No. 89436 [1284], from Utkiavwĭñ) is of antler, 7.2
inches long, with a blade of 2.7 inches, protected from splitting by a
stout round peg of hard bone, driven through the handle so as to lie
against the heel of the blade. It terminates in a blunt point instead of
a hook, and has three finger notches in the haft. No. 89437 [942], also
from Utkiavwĭñ, is of the same material, 5.2 inches long, without a hook
and with a blade only 1 inch long. There are two finger notches in the
haft. The last of the antler mesh sticks (No.&nbsp;89439 [983], from
Utkiavwĭñ, Fig. 320<i>b</i>) is double ended, having a hook and a short
blade at each end. The blades are respectively 1.5 and 1.6 inches long,
and the total length is 6.6 inches. Fig. 320<i>c</i> (No.&nbsp;89435
[1019], also from Utkiavwĭñ) has a blade, with a small hook, of white
compact bone, and what would be the handle lashed to one side of a haft
of soft wood, which is shouldered to receive it. The haft is 4.3 inches
long, and the two parts are held together by two lashings of fine sinew,
kept from slipping by notches. The total length is 7.3 inches, that of
the blade 2.7. Netting needles and mesh sticks of essentially the same
type as those just described, but varying in material and dimensions,
are in general use from the Anderson River to Bristol Bay, as is shown
by the Museum collections.</p>

<p>We collected 16 little ivory implements, each, when complete,
consisting of the image of a fish about 3½ to 4 inches long, suspended
by a string about 4 inches long to a little ivory spring hook. We never
happened to see these implements in use, but we were told that they were
used in netting to keep the meshes in proper shape. They generally were
made in pairs. The only way of using them that I can think of is first
to hook one into the bight of the first mesh made in starting the net.
This would make the successive meshes, as they were netted, hang down
out of the way. On starting the next row in the opposite direction, the
second weight hooked into the first mesh of this row would draw the
successive meshes down on the left-hand side of the stick, while the
other weight would keep the meshes of the first row stretched so that
one could be easily caught at a time. On beginning the third row the
first weight would be transferred to the first mesh of this, and so on.
Fig. 321<i>a</i> is one of a pair of these nĕpĭtaúra (No.&nbsp;56596
[207]) which has been selected as the type. It is a rather rude figure
of a salmon or trout 4 inches long, neatly carved out of walrus ivory.
The string is of braided sinew and the hook of walrus ivory.</p>

<p>Fig. 321<i>b</i> (No. 89442 [899] from Nuwŭk) is a weight without the
hook and made of compact whale’s bone. It is 4.1 inches long, and very
neatly carved, having all the fins in relief, the gill openings, mouth,
and eyes incised. No. 56582 [173] from Utkiavwĭñ is one of a pair very
rudely carved out of a piece of snow-shovel edge. The mouth and gill
openings are indicated by incised and blackened lines, the latter
fringed with short lines, each ending in a dot, perhaps to represent the
gill filaments. It is 4.2 inches long, and hastily made for sale. Fig.
321<i>c</i> (No.&nbsp;56578 [201] from Utkiavwĭñ) seems to be intended
for a polar cod, and has the hole drilled through the root of the tail.
The lateral line is marked by a scratch, colored with black lead, and
the dark color of the back is represented by curved, transverse
scratches also colored with black lead. When the carving is sufficiently
good to show what sort of a fish is meant, it is generally a salmon or
trout. Only 3 out of the 16 are of anything but walrus ivory. These 3
are of compact whale’s bone, and one had small blue glass beads inlaid
for eyes, of which one still remains. The shortest is 3.4 inches long,
and the longest 4.3, but most of them are almost exactly 4 inches
long.</p>

<p>A set of little tools made of bone and reindeer antler were brought
over for sale, which were said to be those used in weaving the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page317" id = "page317">
317</a></span>
feather belts. I&nbsp;had no opportunity of seeing a belt made, but the
work evidently does not require all three of these tools. The little
netting needle or shuttle of bone (Fig. 322, No. 89434 [1338]) can not
be used in feather weaving, because, as already mentioned, the strips of
feather are not fastened together into a continuous cord which could be
carried on a shuttle. It is 5.9 inches long and 0.7 wide. There is also
a little mesh stick of antler (Fig. 323, No. 89438 [1338]) 6.7 inches
long, with a blade 1.9 inches in length, and a little hook, which
appears to be fitted for nothing except netting a small net. The lower
edge of the handle, however, is cut into 10 deep rounded notches, which
perhaps serve the purpose of a rude “frame” for keeping apart the
strands of the warp, while the woof of feather is passed through with
the fingers. It would be held with this edge up, and the beginning of
the belt being fastened to the wall, the warp strands would be stretched
over this, as over a violin bridge, each resting in one of the notches.
The last tool of the set (Fig. 324, No. 89462 [1338]) is undoubtedly a
“sword” for pushing home the woof, and probably also serves to separate
the strands of the warp into a “shed.” It is a flat, thin piece of
antler, 9&nbsp;inches long and three-fourths wide, of which about 6½
inches forms a straight blade 6½ inches long, and the rest is bent round
to one side and slightly down, forming a handle. When the strands of the
warp are stretched over the bridge as above described, pushing this
horizontally through them alternately over and under the successive
strands, would make a “shed” through which the end of the woof could be
thrust with one motion, and pushed up against the preceding strand of
the woof by sliding the sword forward. It would then be withdrawn and
passed through again, going over the strands it went under before and
vice versa, so as to open a “shed” for the next strand of the woof.</p>

<p>For sewing furs and leather they always use thread made by stripping
off thin fibers from a piece of dried sinew of the reindeer, as is usual
with Eskimo. Cotton or linen thread of civilized manufacture is now
often used for sewing the cotton frocks, etc., and sometimes for making
an
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page318" id = "page318">

ornamental seam on the waterproof gut shirts. The stitches employed have
already been described under the head of clothing (which see). They hold
the needle between the thumb and middle finger, with the thimble on the
forefinger (both are called by the same name, tĭ´kyǝ) and sew toward
them. This appears to be the regular Eskimo method of sewing.<a class =

<p>At the present day they are well supplied with steel needles (miksun)
of all sizes and patterns, but formerly they used bone needles made from
the fibula (amĭlyĕrûñ) of the reindeer. We collected sixty of these
needles, eighteen of which appear to be old and genuine. The rest were
more or less carefully made for sale. Nĭkawáalu told us that once when
he and a young man were out deer hunting a long distance from camp their
boots gave out. Having killed a deer he made thread from the sinew,
a&nbsp;needle from the bone, and with pieces of the skin repaired their
boots, so that they got home in comfort.</p>

<p>No. 89389 [1191], Fig. 325 will serve as the type of these needles.
This is a case 3½ inches long, made of the butt of a large quill, closed
with a plug of walrus hide, and contains 6 needles. One is 1.8 inches
long, stout, and round-pointed, with a large eye. It is much discolored
from age. The second is also round-pointed but more slender, 1.9 inches
long, and flattened and expanded at the butt. The third is 2.4 inches
long, and has a four-sided point like a glover’s needle. All three of
these are very neatly made and appear old. The other three are stout,
roughly made, and flat, respectively 2.1, 2.2, and 2.5 inches long. Two
of them look suspiciously new. This set was said to have been the
property of the wife of Puka, Nĭkawáalu’s father.</p>

<p>Fig. 326<i>a</i> is a peculiarly large and flat needle (No. 89392
[1195] from Utkiavwĭñ) 3.2 inches long, with a round, sharp point and a
large eye, with little grooves running to the butt on each side for the
thread to lie in. This needle was perhaps specially
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page319" id = "page319">
319</a></span>
meant for sewing boat skins. With this needle belongs a peculiar large
bone or ivory thimble. The remaining needles are all very much alike,
though some are more roughly made than the others. Three of them have
the butt square instead of rounded, and half of them, including some
which are undoubtedly old, are four-sided at the point like a glover’s
needle. The longest is 3 inches long and the shortest 1.4 inches, but
the commonest length is about 2 or 2½ inches. Similar bone needles are
mentioned by various authors.<a class = "tag" name = "tag420" id =

<p>Nearly all the women now use ordinary metal thimbles, obtained in
trade, but they wear them in the old-fashioned way, on the tip of the
forefinger. Some of the older women, however, still prefer the ancient
leather thimble. There are two patterns of these: one intended for the
fore-finger only, and the other of such a shape that it may also be worn
on the other fingers as a guard against chafing in pulling stout thread
through thick leather. It is often so used at the present day.</p>

<p>We collected three of the first-mentioned pattern, which is
represented by Fig. 326<i>b</i> (No.&nbsp;89396 [1202,1246]). It is made
by cutting out a narrow ring of raw sealskin 0.7 inch in diameter, with
a circular flap 0.5 inch in diameter on the outside of the ring and a
corresponding one on the inside of the same size, cut out of the middle
of the ring. The flaps are doubled over so as to make a pad on the
inside of the forefinger when the tip of the latter is inserted into the
ring. The butt of the needle presses against this pad.</p>

<p>The third thimble, which belongs with the needlecase (No. 89371
[1276]), is of precisely the same form and dimensions.</p>

<p>There appeared to be little if any variation among those which we
saw. Capt. Lyon<a class = "tag" name = "tag421" id = "tag421" href =
"#note421">421</a> figures two similar thimbles from Iglulik, which are
described on page 537 of the same work as being made of leather. The
flaps, however, seem to be only semicircular and not folded over, so
that the shield consists of only one thickness of leather.</p>

<p>A similar thimble with the flap also not folded is used at Cumberland
Gulf.<a class = "tag" name = "tag422" id = "tag422" href =
"#note422">422</a></p>

<p>The other pattern, of which we brought home nine specimens, is
represented by No. 89389 [1191], which belongs with the set of bone
needles of the same number. It is a tube, open at both ends, one of
which is larger than the other, made by bending round a strip of split
walrus hide and sewing the ends together. It is 0.4 inch long and 2.1 in
circumference at the larger end. It is worn smooth with handling, and
impregnated with grease and dirt and marked with small pits where it has
been pressed against the butt of the needle in use.</p>

<p>Four other old thimbles (No. 89393 [1194], from Utkiavwĭñ, are made
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page320" id = "page320">
320</a></span>
in the same way, but are a trifle larger. As they show no needle-marks,
they were probably used only as finger guards. The remaining four are
similar to the above, but newly made, for sale.</p>

<p>A most peculiar thimble, the only one of the kind seen, is shown in
Fig. 326<i>a</i> (No.&nbsp;89392 [1195] from Utkiavwĭñ, belonging with
the large bone needle of the same number already described and figured).
This is made of a single piece of walrus ivory, browned with age, and
the round shallow socket is for the butt of the needle. The ends of the
half ring are slightly expanded and notched on the outside to receive a
string to complete the ring so that it can be fitted round the finger,
with the flange in the same position as the pad of a leather

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 327.&mdash;Needle cases with belt
hooks.</p>
</div>

<p>Needles are kept in a case (ujyami), consisting of a tube of bone or
ivory about 5 or 6 inches long, through which is drawn a broad strap of
leather furnished with a knot at one end to keep it from slipping wholly
through. Into one side of this strap the needles are thrust obliquely,
so that when the strap is pulled in they are covered by the tube. To the
other end of the strap is usually attached an ivory snap hook for
fastening the needle case to the girdle of the pantaloons. These needle
cases are made of two slightly different patterns, of which the first is
represented by No. 89365 [1277], Fig. 327<i>a</i>. It is of white walrus
ivory, 4½ inches long, and the strap is of seal thong about 11 inches
long and 0.3 inch wide. At one end of this is a pear-shaped knob of
walrus ivory, which is shouldered off at the small end and worked into a
short flattened shank perforated with a large eye, through which the end
of the strap, which is cut narrow, is thrust. It is fastened by doubling
it back and sewing it to the standing part. A&nbsp;sky-blue transparent
glass bead is inlaid in the large end of the knob. The other end of the
strap is fastened in the same way into a tranverse slot in the end of
the belt hook (tĭ´tkĭbwĭñ) of ivory, 4.7 inches long.</p>

<p>This pattern appears to be usually made of walrus ivory. Only one of
the six brought home is of bone, and this is an unusually small one,
only 3.6 inches long, made for sale. The usual length is 4½ to 5 inches.
No. 89363 [1105], Fig. 327<i>b</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ, is a tube very much
like the one described, but is ornamented with an incised pattern
colored with red ocher, and has a differently shaped belt hook. When the
latter is hooked over the girdle the ring is pushed up the shank over
the point of the hook till it fits tight, and thus keeps the hook from
slipping off the belt.</p>

321</a></span>
<p>Fig. 328<i>a</i> (No. 89364 [1243] from Utkiavwĭñ) is another ivory
needle case, 4.7 inches long. The tube was once ornamented with incised
patterns, but these are almost wholly worn off by constant handling. The
knob is carved into an ornamental shape, having a circle of six round
knobs round the middle. It has been suggested that this is meant to
represent a cloud-berry (Rubus chamæmorus), a&nbsp;fruit known to the
“Nunatañmiun” though not at Point Barrow. The hook is a snap hook very
much like those described in connection with the netting weights, but
larger (3&nbsp;inches long) and very broad at the upper end, which is
made into a broad ring. The point of a steel needle still sticking in
the flesh side of the strap shows how the needles are carried with the
points toward the knob.</p>

bone needles.</p>
</div>

<p>No. 89370 [1033], also from Utkiavwĭñ, has no knob, but the end of
the strap is kept from slipping through by rolling it up transversely
and catching it with a stitch of sinew. It has a broad flat snap hook
similar to the last, but cut on the edges into ornamental scallops. The
tube is ornamented with an incised pattern colored red with ocher, and
is 5.2 long. No. 56575 [7] is an old tube of brown walrus ivory,
enlarged into a knob at one end. It has no knob or hook, but a new strap
of white seal skin, in the lower end of which is tied a large knot. The
other pattern has the cylinder made of a hollow “long” bone, in its
natural shape. This bone appears to be almost always the humerus of some
large bird, probably a swan. The strap has usually no knob, but is kept
from slipping through by knotting the end or tying on a large bead or a
bear’s toe, or some such object too large to go through the tube. None
of these have belt hooks except one new and roughly made specimen.</p>

<p>These bone tubes are apparently older than the neat ivory cylinders,
and it is not unlikely that the belt hook was not invented till the
former was mostly out of fashion. No. 89361 [1239], Fig. 328<i>b</i>
from Utkiavwĭñ, is one of these which has for knob one of the large dark
blue glass beads which used to bring such enormous prices in the early
days of Arctic trading, and which are still the kind most highly prized.
The
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page322" id = "page322">
322</a></span>
end of the strap is cut narrow, passed through the bead, and knotted on
the end. This case carries a half-dozen of the old-fashioned bone
needles, which appear to be genuine. It is 3.7 inches long and, roughly
speaking, 0.4 in diameter. No. 89369 [1201], also from Utkiavwĭñ,
resembles the above, but has a wolverine’s toe sewed to the end of the
strap. No. 89371 [1276], from Utkiavwĭñ, also has the toe of a wolverine
for a knob, and has a belt hook with two tongues made of reindeer
antler. No. 89366 [1137], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a highly ornamented case of
this pattern, which has a short cylindrical knob, also ornamented. No.
89368 [1089], from Utkiavwĭñ, is not made of bird’s bone, but is a piece
of a long bone from some mammal, and has a brown bear’s toe for a knob.
No. 89367 [1339], from the same village, is roughly made of a branch of
antler, 3.9 inches long and 0.8 wide, hollowed out. It has a knob of
whale’s bone, but no belt hook, the end of the strap being knotted into
a leather thimble of the first pattern. Of the six specimens of this
pattern in the collection only the first is a genuine old implement. All
the others are merely commercial imitations rather carelessly made.</p>

<p>This kind of needle case is very commonly used throughout Alaska, as
is shown by the enormous collections in the National Museum brought home
by various explorers, Nelson, Turner, Dall and others. The needle case
from Iglulik, figured by Capt. Lyon,<a class = "tag" name = "tag423" id
= "tag423" href = "#note423">423</a> resembles the second or older
pattern, being of bone, not tapered at the ends, and having neither knob
nor belt hook. To the ends of the strap are hung thimbles “and other
small articles liable to be lost.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag424" id =
"tag424" href = "#note424">424</a> Dr. Simpson<a class = "tag" name =
"tag425" id = "tag425" href = "#note425">425</a> speaks of the needle
case in use at Point Barrow, but merely describes it as “a&nbsp;narrow
strip of skin in which the needles are stuck, with a tube of bone,
ivory, or iron to slide down over them, and kept from slipping off the
lower end by a knob or large bead.” This appears to refer only to the
second or older pattern.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned ring thimbles were usually carried on the belt hook
of the needlecase, but modern thimbles require a box. These boxes
(kigiunɐ), which are usually small and cylindrical, also serve for
holding thread, beads, and all sorts of little trinkets or knickknacks,
and many of them are so old that they were evidently used for this
purpose long before the introduction of metal thimbles. Little tin
canisters, spice boxes, etc., are also used for the same purpose
nowadays. We brought home thirteen of these boxes, of which No. 89407
[1158] Fig. 329<i>a</i> has been chosen as the type. It is a piece of
the beam of a stout antler, 4.3 inches long, cut off square on the ends
and hollowed out. Into the large end is fitted a flat bottom of thin
pine, fastened in by four little treenails of wood. The cover is of the
same material. It is held on by a string of sinew braid about 11 inches
long, which passes out through the lower of the two little holes on one
side of the box, being held by a knot at
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page323" id = "page323">
323</a></span>
the end, in through the upper, then out and in through two similar holes
in the middle of the cover, and out through a hole on the other side of
the box. Pulling the end of this string draws the cover down snugly into
its place.</p>

<p>Some of the remaining boxes are made of antler, and vary in length
from 4.7 to 8 inches. The last is, however, unusually large, most of the
others being about 5 inches long. The covers are generally held on by
strings much in the manner described, and the ends are both usually of
wood, though two old boxes have both ends made of antler, and one has a
top of hard bone. The last is a specimen newly made for sale. These
boxes are sometimes ornamented on the outside with incised lines,
colored red or blackened, either conventional patterns as in Fig.
329<i>b</i> (No.&nbsp;89405 [1335], from Utkiavwĭñ) or figures of men
and animals as in Fig. 329<i>c</i> (No.&nbsp;56615 [41] from the same
village). The former is a new box, 4.7 inches long, and has the wooden
ends both shouldered to fit tightly. The cover is worked with a
string.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 329.&mdash;Trinket boxes.</p>

<p>No. 56615 [41] on the other hand is very old, and has lost its cover.
The wooden bottom is shouldered and held in with treenails. The surface
is elaborately ornamented with incised and blackened figures. It is
divided by longitudinal lines into four nearly equal panels, on which
the figures are disposed as follows (the animals all being represented
as standing on the longitudinal lines, and facing toward the right, that
is, toward the open end of the box): On the first panel are 4 reindeer,
alternately a buck and a doe, followed by a man in a kaiak, and over his
head two small “circles and dots,” one above the other.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page324" id = "page324">
324</a></span>
All the deer on this box are represented strictly in profile, so as to
show only two legs and one antler each. On the second panel are 4 deer,
all does, followed by a man with a bow slung across his back. On the
third, a&nbsp;man in the middle appears to be calling 2 dogs, who, at
the left of the panel, are drawing a railed sled. Reversed, and on the
upper border of the panel, is a man pushing behind a similar sled drawn
by 3 dogs. The head dog has stopped and is sitting down on his haunches.
The dogs, like the reindeer, are all strictly in profile and rather
conventionalized. In the fourth panel are 3 reindeer followed by a man
in his kaiak, and upside down, above, a&nbsp;deer without legs, supposed
to be swimming in the water, and a very rude figure of a man in his
kaiak. These figures probably represent actual occurrences, forming a
sort of record.</p>

<p>Fig. 330<i>a</i> (No. 89408 [1371] from Sidaru) is a piece of stout
antler, 4.7 inches long, which has the bottom of pine fitted tightly in
without fastenings. The cover is of wood, covered, to make it fit tight,
with parchment, apparently shrunk on and puckered on the upper surface.
A&nbsp;thick hank of untwisted sinew is fastened as a handle through the
middle of the cover. This box is old and dirty, and contains an
unfinished flint arrow-head. No. 56505 [59] from Utkiavwĭñ, is a new
box, closed at the ends with thick shouldered plugs of pine wood. The
tube is 8 inches long and ornamented with a conventional pattern of
incised lines colored with red ocher.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page325" id = "page325">
325</a></span>
<p>Fig. 330<i>b</i> (No. 89402 [1359] also from Utkiavwĭñ), is peculiar
from the material of which it is made. It is of about the same pattern
as the common antler boxes, but is made of the butt end of the <i>os
penis</i> of a large walrus, cut off square and hollowed out, and has
ends of hard whale’s bone. Its length is 4.2 inches. No. 89403 [1425]
Fig. 331 from Sidaru, is made of the hollow butt of a good-sized walrus
tusk, 3.2 inches long. It has a neatly fitted wooden bottom, held in
with 6 treenails, two of ivory and four of wood. The box has been
cracked and split and mended with stitches of sinew and whalebone.
Peculiar conventional patterns are incised on the box and cover.
A&nbsp;peculiar box is shown in Fig. 332 (No.&nbsp;56583 [37] from
Utkiavwĭñ). This is of compact white bone, with a flat wooden bottom.
I&nbsp;do not recollect seeing any other boxes of the same sort.</p>

<p>The most peculiar box of all, however, is shown in Fig. 334
(No.&nbsp;56512 [2] from Utkiavwĭñ), the only specimen of the kind seen.
It is 5.5 inches long, made of reindeer antler, and very neatly carved
into a most excellent image of a reindeer lying on its left side, with
the head, which has no antlers, turned down and to the left. The legs
are folded up against the belly, the forelegs with the hoofs pointing
backward, the hind hoofs pointing forward. The eyes are represented by
small sky-blue glass beads, and the mouth, nostrils, and navel neatly
incised, the last being particularly well-marked. The tips of the hoofs
are rounded off, which, taken in connection with the attitude and the
well marked navel, lead me to believe
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page326" id = "page326">
326</a></span>
that the image is meant to represent an unborn fetus. The whole of the
body is hollowed, the aperture taking up the whole of the buttocks, and
closed by a flat, thick plug of soft wood. A&nbsp;round peg of wood is
driven in to close an accidental hole just above the left shoulder. The
box is old and discolored, and worn smooth with much handling.</p>

<p>Rarely these little workboxes are made of basketwork. We obtained
four specimens of these small baskets, of which No. 56564 [88] Fig. 335,
workbasket (águma, áma, ipiáru), will serve as the type. The neck is of
black tanned sealskin, 2½ inches long, and has 1 vertical seam, to the
middle of which is sewed the middle of a piece of fine seal thong,
a&nbsp;foot long, which serves to tie up the mouth. The basket appears
to be made of fine twigs or roots of the willow, with the bark removed,
and is made by winding an osier spirally into the shape of the basket,
and wrapping a narrow splint spirally around the two adjacent parts of
this, each turn of the splint being separated from the next by a turn of
the succeeding tier. The other basket from Utkiavwĭñ (No.&nbsp;56565
[135]) is almost exactly like this, but larger (3.5 inches in diameter
and 2.2 high), and has holes round the top of the neck for the
drawstring.</p>

<p>Two baskets from Sidaru are of the same material and workmanship, but
somewhat larger and of a different shape, as shown in Fig. 336, No.
89801 [1366], and Fig. 337, No. 89802 [1427]. This was the only species
of basketwork seen among these people and is probably not of native
manufacture.</p>

<p>Prof. O. T. Mason, of the National Museum, has called my attention to
the fact that the method of weaving employed in making these baskets is
the same as that used by the Apaches and Navajos, who have been shown to
be linguistically of the same stock as the Athabascan or Tinné group of
Indians of the North. The first basket collected, No. 56564 [88], was
said by the owner to have come from the “great river” in the south. Now,
the name Kuwûk or Kowak, applied to the western stream flowing into
Hotham Inlet, means simply “great river,” and this is the region where
the Eskimo come into very intimate commercial relations with Indians of
Tinné stock.<a class = "tag" name = "tag426" id = "tag426" href =
"#note426">426</a> Therefore, in consideration of the Indian
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page327" id = "page327">
327</a></span>
workmanship of these baskets, and the statement that one of them came
from the “great river, south,” I&nbsp;am well convinced that they were
made by the Indians of the region between the Koyukuk and Silawĭk
Rivers, and sold by them to the Kuwûñmiun, whence they could easily find
their way to Point Barrow through the hands of the “Nunatañmiun”
traders.</p>

<p>The Eskimo of Alaska south of Bering Strait make and use baskets of
many patterns, but east of Point Barrow baskets are exceedingly rare.
The only mention of anything of the kind will be found in Lyon’s
Journal.<a class = "tag" name = "tag427" id = "tag427" href =
"#note427">427</a> He mentions seeing at Iglulik a “small round basket
composed of grass in precisely the same manner as those constructed by
the Tibboo, in the southern part of Fezzan, and agreeing with them also
in its shape.” Now, these Africans make baskets of precisely the same
“coiled” work (as&nbsp;Prof. Mason calls&nbsp;it) as the Tinné, so that
in all probability what Lyon saw was one of these same baskets, carried
east in trade, like other western objects already referred to. The name
áma applied to these baskets at Point Barrow (the other two names appear
to be simply “bag” or receptacle) corresponds to the Greenlandic amåt,
the long thin runners from the root of a tree, “at present used in the
plural also for a basket of European basketwork,” (because they had no
idea that twigs could be so small)&mdash;Grønlandske Ordbog.</p>

<p>No. 89799 [1329] from Utkiavwĭñ, is a peculiar bag, the only one of
the kind seen, used for the same purpose as the boxes and baskets just
described. It is the stomach of a polar bear, with the muscular and
glandular layers removed, dried and carefully worked down with a skin
scraper into something like goldbeater’s skin. This makes a large,
nearly spherical bag 7½ inches in diameter, of a pale brownish color,
soft and wrinkled, with a mouth 6 inches wide. A&nbsp;small hole has
been mended by drawing the skin together and winding it round tightly on
the inside with sinew.</p>

<p>Like all the rest of the Eskimo race, the natives of Point Barrow use
the kaiak, or narrow, light, skin-covered canoe, completely decked over
except at the middle, where there is a hole or cockpit in which the man
sits. Although nearly every male above the age of boyhood owns and can
manage one of these canoes, they are much less generally employed than
by any other Eskimo whose habits have been described, except the “Arctic
highlanders,” who have no boats, and perhaps those of Siberia and their
Chuckche companions. The kaiak is used only during the season of open
water, and then but little in the sea in the neighborhood of the
villages. Those who remain near the villages in the summer use the kaiak
chiefly for making the short excursions to the lakes and streams inland,
already described, after reindeer, and for making short trips from camp
to camp along the coast. At Pernyû they are used in setting the
stake-nets and also for retrieving fowl which have fallen in the water
when shot.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Simpson<a class = "tag" name = "tag428" id =
"tag428" href = "#note428">428</a> the men of the parties which go east
in the summer travel in their kaiaks after reaching the open water “to
make room in the large boat for the oil-skins.” We obtained no
information regarding this. It is at this time, probably, that the kaiak
comes specially in play for spearing molting fowl and “flappers”, and
for catching seals with the kúkiga. They manage the kaiak with great
skill and confidence, but we never knew them to go out in rough weather,
nor did we ever see the practice, so frequently described elsewhere, of
tying the skirts of the waterproof jacket round the coaming of the
cockpit so as to exclude the water.</p>

<p>It should, however, be borne in mind that from the reasons above
stated our opportunities for observing the use of the kaiak were very
limited. At all events it is certain that the people depend mainly on
the umiak, not only for traveling, but for hunting and fishing as well,
which places them in strong contrast with the Greenlanders, who are
essentially a race of kaiakers and have consequently developed the boat
and its appendages to a high state of perfection.</p>

<p>We brought home one complete full-sized kaiak, with its paddle, No.
57773 [539], Fig. 338<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, which is a very fair
representative of the canoes used at Point Barrow. This is 19 feet long
and 18 inches wide amidships. The gunwales are straight, except for a
very slight sheer at the bow, and the cockpit is 21 inches long and 18½
inches wide. It has a frame of wood, which appears to be all of spruce,
held together by treenails and whalebone lashings, and is covered with
white-tanned sealskins with the grain side out. The stoutest part of the
frame is the two gunwales, each 3¼ inches broad and ½-inch thick, flat,
and rounded off on the upper edge inside, running the whole length of
the boat and meeting
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page329" id = "page329">
329</a></span>
at the stem and stern, gradually tapered up on the lower edge at each
end. The ribs, of which there are at least forty-three, are bent into
nearly a half-circle, thus making a U-shaped midship section, and are
¾-inch wide by ⅓-inch thick, flat on the outer side and round on the
inner. Their ends are mortised into the lower edge of the gunwale and
fastened with wooden treenails. They are set in about 3 inches apart and
decrease gradually in size fore and aft. Outside of these are seven
equidistant streaks running fore and aft, ¾&nbsp;inch to 1 inch wide and
¼ inch thick, of which the upper on each side reaches neither stem nor
stern. These are lashed to the ribs with a strip of whalebone, which
makes a round turn about one rib, above the streak, going under the rib
first, and a similar turn round the next rib below the streak (Fig.

<p>There is a stout keelson, hemi-elliptical in section, under the
cockpit only. This is 4½ feet long, about 2 inches deep, and 1½ inches
wide, and is fastened in the middle and about 1 foot from each end by a
strip of whalebone, which passes through a transverse hole in the
keelson, round the rib on one side, back through the keelson, and round
the rib on the other side twice. The end is wrapped spirally round the
turns on one side and tucked into the hole in the keelson. The deck
beams are not quite so stout as the ribs and are mortised into the upper
edge of the gunwales a little below the level of the deck. The ends are
secured by lashings or stitches of some material which are concealed by
the skin cover. They are about as far apart as the ribs, but neither
exactly correspond nor break joints with the latter.</p>

</div>

<p>At the after end of the cockpit is an extra stout beam or thwart to
support the back, 1¾ inches wide and three-quarters inch thick, with
rounded edges, the ends of which are apparently lashed with thong. The
first beam forward of the cockpit is rounded, and appears to be a
natural crook forming a <span class = "sans">U</span>-shaped arch, and
is followed by seven <span class = "sans">V</span>-shaped knees,
thickest in the middle and enlarged a little at the ends, successively
decreasing in height to the seventh, which is almost straight. This
makes the rise in the deck forward of the cockpit.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page330" id = "page330">
330</a></span>
<p>Every alternate deck beam is braced to the gunwale at each end by an
oblique lashing of whalebone, running from a transverse hole in the beam
about 1 inch from the gunwale to a corresponding hole in the gunwale,
three-quarters inch from the lower edge. The lashing makes three or four
turns through these holes and around the lower edge of the gunwale, and
the end is wrapped spirally round these turns for their whole length.
Above these beams a narrow batten runs fore and aft amidships from
cockpit to stem and stern, mortised into the two beams at the cockpit,
and lashed to the others with whalebone. The coaming of the cockpit is
made of a single flat piece of wood, 1¾ inches broad and one-quarter
inch thick, bent into a hoop with the ends lapping about 6 inches and
“sewed” together with stitches of whalebone. Round the upper edge of
this, on the outside, is fitted a “half-round” hoop, which appears to be
made of willow, three-quarters by one-third inch, with its ends lapped
about 4 inches, this lap coming over the joint of the larger hoop. It is
fastened on by short stitches of whalebone about 5 or 6 inches apart,
leaving room enough between the two hoops to allow a lacing of fine
whalebone to pass through. The coaming is put on over the edge of the
skin cover, which is drawn up tight inside of the coaming and over its
upper edge and fastened by a lacing of whalebone, which runs spirally
round the outer hoop and through holes about one-half inch apart in the
edge of the cover.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 340.&mdash;Double kayak
paddle.</p>
</div>

<p>The coaming fits over the crown of the arch of the forward deck beam
and rests on the middle of the thwart aft, and is secured by lashings of
whalebone, which pass through holes in the coaming and over its upper
edge. The forward lashing makes three turns, which pass round the beam
with the end wrapped spirally round the parts between beam and coaming;
the after lashing, four similar turns, which pass through a hole in the
thwart and around its forward edge. On each side is a stout vertical
brace of wood 3¼ inches long, 1&nbsp;inch wide, and one-half inch thick,
with rounded edges and corners. The ends are cut out parallel to the
breadth, so that one end fits on to the upper edge of the gunwale, while
the other receives the lower edge of the coaming, protruding on the
outside through a hole in the cover.</p>

<p>The cover is of six sealskins, put together heads to tails, so that
there is only one longitudinal seam, which runs irregularly along the
deck. The transverse seams, which run obliquely across the bottom are
double and sewed
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page331" id = "page331">
331</a></span>
with a blind stitch, like the seams already described on the waterproof
boots, from the inside. These seams are nearly 2 inches wide. The
longitudinal seam is sewed in the same way from the outside, but not so
broadly lapped, with the edge turned over into a roll. There are two
pieces of stout thong stretched across the deck, one forward of the
cockpit and the other aft, which serve to fasten articles to the deck.
The thong passes out through a hole in the gunwale, one-half inch from
the upper edge and 6 inches from the cockpit, on the starboard side
forward and on the port side aft, and is secured by a knot in the end
inboard. The other end passes in through a corresponding hole in the
other gunwale and is loosely knotted to the deck beams, so that the line
can be slackened off or tautened up at pleasure. Three feet from the bow
is a becket for holding spears, etc., fastened into two little holes
bored diagonally outward through the edge of the gunwales. It is of two
parts of seal thong, one part twisted round the other, but is broken in
the middle, so that only one-half of it is left. The weight of this
kaiak in its present dry condition is 32 pounds.</p>

<p>This is about the ordinary pattern of kaiak used at Point Barrow, and
is a medium-sized one. These boats are made to fit the size of the
owner, a&nbsp;youth or small man using a much smaller and lighter kaiak
than a heavy adult. They are never made to carry more than one person,
and I have never heard of their being used by the women. In carrying the
kaiak across the land from lake to lake, it is held horizontally against
the side with the bow pointing forward, by thrusting the forearm into
the cockpit. We never saw them carried on the head, in the manner
practised at Fury and Hecla Straits.<a class = "tag" name = "tag429" id
= "tag429" href = "#note429">429</a></p>

<p>In entering the canoe the man takes great care to wipe his feet clean
of sand and gravel, which would work down under the timbers and chafe
the skin. The canoe is launched in shoal water, preferably alongside of
a little bank, and the man steadies it by sticking down his paddle on
the outer side and holding it with his left hand, while he balances
himself on his right foot, and with his free hand carefully wipes his
left foot. He then steps with his left foot into the kaiak, and still
balancing himself with the help of the paddle, lifts and wipes his right
foot before he steps in with that. He then pushes his feet and legs
forward under the raised deck, settles himself in a proper position for
trimming the boat, and shoves off. As elsewhere, the kaiak is always
propelled with a paddle.</p>

<p>No. 89246 [539], Fig. 340, is the paddle which belongs to the kaiak
just described. It is 7 feet long. The shaft joining the blades is
elliptical in section, with its greatest width at right angles to the
plane of the blades so to present the greatest resistance to the strain
of paddling. The shape of the blade, with rounded tip and thin rounded
edges is <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads‘admirally’">admirably</ins> adapted to give the blade a clean entry
into the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page332" id = "page332">
332</a></span>
water. The whole is very neatly and smoothly made, and the blades are
painted with red ocher. This is a much more effective paddle than those
used by the Greenlanders and other eastern Eskimo, the blades of which,
probably from the scarcity of wood<a class = "tag" name = "tag430" id =
"tag430" href = "#note430">430</a> are very narrow, not exceeding 4
inches in width. In Greenland and Labrador, also, the blades are square
at the ends like those of ordinary oars, and are usually edged with bone
to prevent them from splitting. The absence of this bone edging on the
paddles from Point Barrow perhaps indicates that they are meant for
summer use only and not for working among the ice. In accordance with
the general custom in northwestern America, the double-bladed paddle
(páutĭñ) is used only when great speed is desired, as in chasing game.
It is handled in the usual way, being grasped with both hands near the
middle, and dipped alternately on opposite sides. For ordinary traveling
they use a single-bladed paddle (áñun), of the same shape as those used
in the umiak but usually somewhat smaller, of which we neglected to
procure a specimen. With this they make a few strokes on one side, till
the boat begins to sheer, then shift it over and make a few strokes, on
the other side. They do this with very great skill, getting considerable
speed, and making a remarkably straight wake. The use of this single
paddle appears to be universal along the coast of Alaska, from Point
Barrow southward, and it is also used at the Mackenzie and Anderson
rivers, as shown by the models collected by MacFarlane in that region.
It is, however, unknown among the eastern Eskimo about whom we have any
definite information on the subject, namely, the Greenlanders, the
people of Baffin Land, Hudson Strait, and Labrador.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag431" id = "tag431" href = "#note431">431</a></p>

<p>Curiously enough the Greenlanders had a superstition of a sort of
malevolent spirits called kajariak, who were “kayakmen of an
extraordinary size, who always seem to be met with at a distance from
land beyond the usual hunting grounds. They were skilled in the arts of
sorcery, particularly in the way of raising storms and bringing bad
weather. Like the umiarissat [other fabulous beings], <i>they use
one-bladed paddles</i>, like those of the Indians.”<a class = "tag" name
= "tag432" id = "tag432" href = "#note432">432</a> This tradition either
refers back to a time when the ancestors of the Greenlanders used the
single paddle or to occasional and perhaps hostile meetings between
eastern and western Eskimo.</p>

<p>Though the kaiak is essentially the same wherever used, it differs
considerably in size and external appearance in different localties. The
kaiak of the Greenlanders is perhaps the best-known model, as it has
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page333" id = "page333">
333</a></span>
been figured and described by many authors. It is quite as light and
sharp as the Point Barrow model, but has a flat floor, the bilge being
angular instead of rounded, and it has considerably more sheer to the
deck, the stem and stern being prolonged into long curved points, which
project above the water, and are often shod with bone or ivory. The
coaming of the cockpit also is level, or only slightly raised forward.
The kaiaks used in Baffin Land, Hudson Straits, and Labrador are of a
very similar model, but larger and heavier, having the projecting points
at the bow and stern rather shorter and less sharp, and the coaming of
the cockpit somewhat more raised forward. Both of these forms are
represented by specimens and numerous models in the museum collections.
I&nbsp;have seen one flat-floored kaiak at Point Barrow. It belonged to
a youth and was very narrow and light.</p>

<p>The kaiak in use at Fury and Hecla Straits, as described by Capt.
Lyon<a class = "tag" name = "tag433" id = "tag433" href =
"#note433">433</a> and Capt. Parry<a class = "tag" name = "tag434" id =
"tag434" href = "#note434">434</a> is of a somewhat different model,
approaching that used at the Anderson River. It is a large kaiak 25 feet
long, with the bow and stern sharp and considerably more bent up than in
the Greenland kaiaks, but round-bottomed, like the western kaiaks. The
deck is flat, with the cockpit coaming somewhat raised forward.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag435" id = "tag435" href = "#note435">435</a></p>

<p>In the kaiaks used at the Anderson and Mackenzie rivers, as shown by
the models in the National Museum, the bending up of the stem and stern
posts is carried to an extreme, so that they make an angle of about 130°
with the level of the deck. The bottom is round and the cockpit nearly
level, but sufficient room for the knees and feet is obtained by arching
not only the deck beams just forward of the cockpit, but all of them
from stem to stern, so that the deck slopes away to each side like the
roof of a house. At Point Barrow, as already described, the deck beams
are arched only just forward of the cockpit, and the stem and stern are
not prolonged. This appears to be the prevailing form of canoe at least
as far south as Kotzebue Sound and is sometimes used by the Malemiut of
Norton Sound. At Port Clarence the heavy, large kaiak, so common from
Norton Sound southward, appears to be in use from Nordenskiöld’s
description, as he speaks of the kaiaks holding two persons, sitting
back to back in the cockpit.<a class = "tag" name = "tag436" id =
"tag436" href = "#note436">436</a> The kaiaks of the southwestern Eskimo
are, as far as I have been able to learn, large and heavy, with level
coamings, with the deck quite steeply arched fore and aft, and with bow
and stern usually of some peculiar shape, as shown by models in the
Museum. See also Dall’s figure (Alaska, p.&nbsp;15.)<a class = "tag"

<p>While the kaiak, however, differs so much in external appearance in
different localities, it is probable that in structure it is everywhere
essentially the same. Only two writers have given a detailed description
of the frame of a kaiak, and these are from widely distant localities,
Iglulik and western Greenland, both still more widely distant from Point
Barrow, and yet both give essentially the same component parts as are to
be found at Point Barrow, namely, two comparatively stout gunwales
running from stem to stern, braced with transverse deckbeams,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag438" id = "tag438" href = "#note438">438</a> seven
streaks running fore and aft along the bottom, knees, or ribs in the
form of hoops, and a hoop for the coaming, bound together with whalebone
or sinew.<a class = "tag" name = "tag439" id = "tag439" href =

<p>The double-bladed paddle is almost exclusively an Eskimo contrivance.
The only other hyperborean race, besides the Aleuts, who use it, are the
Yukagirs, who employ it in their narrow dugout canoes on the River
Kolyma in Siberia.<a class = "tag" name = "tag440" id = "tag440" href =

Malay Archipelago.</p>

<p>Fig. 341, (No. 56561 [224] from Utkiavwiñ) is a very neatly made
model of a kaiak, 13.3 inches long. It is quite accurate in all its
details, but has only five streaks on the bottom, and its width and
depth are about twice what they should be in proportion to the length.
The frame is lashed together with fine sinew and covered with seal
entrail. The paddle is also out of proportion. Many similar neatly
finished
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page335" id = "page335">
335</a></span>
models were made for sale. The natives are so skillful in making them
that it is possible that they are in the habit of making them for the
children to play with. I&nbsp;do not, however, recollect ever seeing a
child with one.</p>

<p>The large skin-covered open boat, essentially the same in model as
that employed by almost all Eskimo, as well as the Aleuts and some
Siberian races, is the chief means of conveyance by water, for
traveling, hunting, and fishing. Though the women do a great share of
the work of navigating the boat when a single family or a small party is
making a journey, it is by no means considered as a woman’s boat, as
appears to be the case among the Greenlanders and eastern Eskimo
generally.<a class = "tag" name = "tag441" id = "tag441" href =
"#note441">441</a> On the contrary, women are not admitted into the
regularly organized whaling crews, unless the umialik can not procure
men enough, and in the “scratch” crews assembled for walrus hunting or
sealing there are usually at least as many men as women, and the men
work as hard as the women. I&nbsp;do not, however, recollect that I ever
saw a man pull an oar in the umiak. They appear always to use paddles
alone. This is interesting in connection with the Greenland custom
mentioned by Egede in the continuation of the passage just quoted: “And
when they first set out for the whale fishing, the men sit in a very
negligent posture, with their faces turned towards the prow, pulling
with their little ordinary paddle; but the women sit in the ordinary
way, with their faces towards the stern, rowing with long oars.”</p>

<p>We were unable to bring home any specimen of these boats on account
of their size, but Fig. 342, from a photograph by Lieut. Ray, will give
a good idea of the framework. These boats vary considerably in size, but
are usually very nearly the dimensions of an ordinary
whaleboat&mdash;that is, about 30 feet in length, with a beam of 5 or 6
feet and a depth of about 2½ feet. The boat resembles very much in model
the American fisherman’s dory, having a narrow flat bottom, sharp at
both ends, with flaring sides, and considerable rake at stem and stern.
Both floor and rail have a strong sheer, fore and aft, and the gunwales
extend beyond the stem so as to meet at the bow. Both stem and stern are
sharp nearly to the rail, where they flare out and are cut off square.
These boats are exceedingly light and buoyant, and capable of
considerable speed when fully manned. They are very “quick” in their
motion and quite crank till they get down to their bearings, but beyond
that appear to be very stiff.</p>

<p>I never heard of one being capsized, though the natives move about
aboard of them with perfect freedom. The frame is neatly made of pieces
of driftwood, which it usually takes a considerable time to
accumulate.<a class = "tag" name = "tag442" id = "tag442" href =
"#note442">442</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page336" id = "page336">
336</a></span>
<p>A stout square timber, of perhaps 3 inches scantling, runs along the
middle of the bottom forming a keel or keelson. This of necessity is
usually made of several pieces of wood scarfed together and fastened
with treenails and whalebone lashings. At each end it is fastened in the
same way to the stem and sternpost, which are both of the same shape,
broad and flat above or inside, but beveled off to a keel outside, and
curving up in a knee, at the same time tapering off to the point where
the bow (or&nbsp;stern) begins to flare. Here it is mortised into the
under side of a trapezoidal block of wood, widest and thickest on the
inboard end, and concaved off on the under face, to a thin edge
outboard. It is held on by a transverse lashing passing through holes in
the end of the post and the thickest part of the block. Along each side
of the bottom, at what would be the bilge of a round bottom boat, runs a
stout streak, thinner and wider than the keelson and set up edgewise.
These are spread apart amidships, but bent together fore and aft so as
to be scarfed into the stem and sternpost (see diagram, Fig.
343<i>a</i>).</p>

<p class = "illustration"><a name = "fig342" id = "fig342"></a>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 342.&mdash;Frame of umiak.</p>

<p>On the model they are fastened here with treenails, and this is
probably also the case on the large canoes. They are spread apart by
cross pieces or floor timbers, flat rather broad boards laid across the
keelson with their ends mortised into the bilge streaks. These are
longest amidships and decrease regularly in length fore and aft. There
were fifteen of them on Nikawáalu’s umiak. On the model they are pegged
to the keelson and bilge streaks. The ribs are straight, slender, square
timbers, eighteen on each side (on&nbsp;Nikawáalu’s umiak; the canoe
photographed has fifteen). These are all of the same length, but fitted
obliquely to the outer edge of the bilge-streaks in such a way (see
diagram, Fig.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page337" id = "page337">
337</a></span>
343<i>b</i>) that those amidships slant considerably outward while the
others become gradually more and more erect fore and aft, thus producing
the sheer in the lines. To these ribs, inside, a&nbsp;little below the
middle of each, is fastened a streak on each side, of about the
dimensions of the bilge streak, running from stem to stern, and the
gunwales are fitted into the notched ends of the ribs, where they are
secured by lashings of whalebone. These on Nikawáalu’s umiak were each a
single round pole about 2 inches in diameter. Such long pieces of wood
as this were probably obtained by trade from the Nunatañmeun. These
extend about 2½ or 3 feet beyond the stem, to which they are fastened on
each side by whalebone lashings, and meet at a sharp angle, being lashed
together with whalebone. On the model, this lashing passes through holes
in both gunwales and round underneath. The gunwales are fastened to the
sternpost in the same way as to the stem, in both cases resting on the
upper surface of the block so as to form a low rail, but project only 5
or 6 inches.</p>

</div>

<p>Between the post and the last pair of long ribs at each end are two
pairs of short ribs running only from the gunwale to the inside streak.
The frame is still further strengthened by an outside streak between the
bilge streak and the inside streak, and Nikawáalu’s canoe had an extra
streak of “half-round” willow outside of the latter. The thwarts rest on
the inside streak and are secured by whalebone lashings. The block or
head of the stern-post serves as a high seat for the steersman.
Crantz’s<a class = "tag" name = "tag443" id = "tag443" href =
"#note443">443</a> description and diagram show that the frame of the
Greenland umiak consists of essentially the same timbers, lacking only
the two outside streaks.</p>

<p>The cover is made of the skins of the larger marine animals. Walrus
hide is often used and sometimes the skin of the polar bear, which makes
a beautifully white cover, but the skin of the bearded seal is
preferred, the people from Point Barrow sometimes making journeys to
Wainwright Inlet in search of such skins, which are dressed with their
oil in them in the manner already referred to. We were informed that six
of these skins were required to cover one umiak. They are put together
in the same way as the skins for the kaiak and sewed with the same seam.
The edges of the cover are stretched over the gunwale, and laced to the
inside streak with a stout thong, which passes through holes in the edge
of the cover. At stem and stern the cover is laced with a separate thong
to a stout transverse lashing of thong running from gunwale to gunwale
close to the edge of the posthead.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page338" id = "page338">
338</a></span>
<p>The cover is removed in the winter and stowed away on the cache frame
or some other safe place (Mûñialu, when preparing to start for the
spring deer hunt in 1883, carefully buried his boat cover in a snowbank)
out of reach of the dogs, and the frame is placed bottom upwards on a
staging 4 or 5 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>When they are ready to refit the canoe for the spring whaling,
a&nbsp;hole is cut in the sea ice close to the shore, and the cover
immersed in the sea water for several days to soften it, the hole being
covered with slabs of snow to keep it from freezing up. Crantz<a class =
"tag" name = "tag444" id = "tag444" href = "#note444">444</a> mentions a
similar custom in Greenland. After removing the hair from the boat-skins
“they lay them in salt water for some days to soften them again, and so
cover the women’s boats and kajaks with them.” When not in use, the
umiak is drawn up on the beach and usually laid bottom upward with the
gear, spears, etc., underneath it, but sometimes propped up on one
gunwale to make a shelter against the wind. This is a common practice in
the camp at Pernyû, where there is usually at least one boat set up
edgewise, sheltered by which the men sit to whittle and gossip.</p>

<p>In the whaling camp at Imêkpûñ in 1883, the boats which were not
ready to go out to the open water were laid up bottom up with one end
resting on a sled set up on its side and the other supported by a block
of snow. They do not appear to be in the habit of using the canoe for a
tent, as is said to be the custom among the more southern natives,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag445" id = "tag445" href = "#note445">445</a> as
they always carry a tent with them on their journeys. The umiak is
propelled by paddles, oars, and a sail, and in smooth weather when the
shore is clear of ice by “tracking” along the beach with men and dogs,
one person at least always remaining on board to steer with a paddle at
the stern.</p>

<p>The sail, which they are only able to use with a free wind, is
square, narrow, and rather high, and is nowadays always made of
drilling. Dark blue drilling appeared to be the most popular sort at the
time of our visit. The head of the sail is laced to a light yard, and
hoisted to the masthead by a halyard through a hole in the latter. The
mast is a stout square pole 10 or 12 feet long and is set up well
forward of amidships, without a step, the square butt resting against a
bottom board, and held up by two forestays and two backstays, running
from the masthead to the inside streak. All the rigging, stays,
halyards, towing line, etc., are made of stout thong. The Greenlanders
set up the mast in the bow of the umiak&mdash;as a sailor would say, “in
the very eyes of her,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag446" id = "tag446"
href = "#note446">446</a> but as far as I can learn the Western Eskimo
all set it up as at Point Barrow.</p>

<p>The oars are very clumsily made with very narrow blades not over 3
inches broad. They are about 7 feet long and somewhat enlarged at the
loom. Instead of resting in rowlocks, they are secured by two long
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page339" id = "page339">
339</a></span>
loops of thong as in the diagram Fig. 344. To keep the oar from chafing
the skin on the gunwale, they lash to the latter a long plate of bone.
No. 89696 [1197] from Utkiavwĭñ is one of these plates. Two of these
oars are commonly used in an umiak, one forward and one aft, and the
women row with great vigor, swinging well from the hips, but do not keep
stroke. The use of oars is so unusual among savages that it would be
natural to suppose that these people had adopted the custom from the
whites. If this be the case, the custom reached them long ago, and
through very indirect channels.</p>

<p>When Thomas Simpson, in 1837, bought an umiak from some Point Barrow
natives at Dease Inlet, he bought with it “four of their slender oars,
which they used as tent poles, besides a couple of paddles; fitted the
oars with lashings, and arranged our strange vessel so well that the
ladies were in raptures, declaring us to be genuine Esquimaux, and not
poor white men.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag447" id = "tag447" href =
"#note447">447</a> The custom, moreover, appears to be widespread since
Lyon speaks of seeing in 1821, “two very clumsy oars with flat blades,
pulled by women,” in the umiaks at Hudson Strait.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag448" id = "tag448" href = "#note448">448</a> It was practiced at a

oar of umiak.</p>

<p>While at Point Barrow the oars have very narrow blades and the double
paddles very broad ones, the reverse seemed to be the case in Greenland,
where the double paddle, as already noticed, has blades not over 3 or 4
inches broad. Crantz describes the oars as “short and broad before,
pretty much like a shovel, but only longer, and * * confined to their
places on the gunnel with a strap of seal’s leather.” (Vol. 2,
p.&nbsp;149 and pl. <span class = "smallroman">VI</span>) Although both
oars and sails are undoubtedly quite ancient inventions (Frobisher in
his description of Meta Incognita in Hakluyt’s Voyages (1589) pp. 621
and 628, speaks of skin boats with sails of entrail),<a class = "tag"
name = "tag450" id = "tag450" href = "#note450">450</a> I&nbsp;am
strongly inclined to believe that they are both considerably more recent
than the paddles, not only on general principles, but from the fact that
the whaling umiaks at Point Barrow use only paddles. There is no
practical reason against using either oars or sails, and in fact the
latter would often be of great advantage in silently approaching a
whale, as the American whalemen have long
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page340" id = "page340">
340</a></span>
ago discovered. It seems to me that this is merely another case of
adhering to an obsolete custom on semireligious grounds. The paddles are
usually about 4 or 5 feet long, made of one piece of driftwood, with
slender round shafts, and lanceolate blades about 6 inches broad, and a
short rounded cross handle at the upper end. (Fig. 345 shows two of the
paddles belonging to the model.) The steersman uses a longer paddle, and
stands in the stern or sits up on the head of the sternpost.</p>

<p>Fig. 345<i>a</i> represents the model (No. 56563 [225] from
Utkiavwĭñ), which gives a very good idea of the shape of one of these
boats. It is quite correct in all its parts, though the timbers are
rather too heavy, and there are not so many ribs and floor timbers as in
a full-sized canoe. The breadth of beam, 6.2 inches, is at least 1 inch
too great in proportion to the length, 25 inches. The cover is one piece
of seal skin which has been partially tanned by the “white-tanning”
process, and put on wet. In drying it has turned almost exactly the
color of a genuine boat cover. The frame, as is often the case with a
full-sized boat, is painted all over with red ocher. (See Fig.
345<i>b</i>, inside plan.)</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 346.&mdash;Ivory bailer for
umiak.</p>

<p>For bailing these boats a long narrow dipper of ivory or bone is
used, of such a shape as to be especially well suited for working in
between the floor timbers. Fig. 346 represents one of these
(No.&nbsp;56536 [40] from Utkiavwĭñ). It is a piece of walrus tusk 16.3
inches long. The cavity is 1.1 inches deep and was excavated by drilling
vertical holes and cutting away the substance between them. Some of the
holes have not been completely worked out. A&nbsp;similar bailer
(No.&nbsp;89835 [1010] also
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page341" id = "page341">
341</a></span>
from Utkiavwĭñ) is made of reindeer antler, a&nbsp;substance much more
easily worked than the ivory, as the soft interior tissue exposed by
cutting the upper side flat is readily carved out. As with the walrus
tusk, the natural curve of the material gives the proper inclination to
the handle. It is 18.3 inches long.</p>

<p>When the umiak is fitted out for whaling a stout <span class =
"sans">U</span>-shaped crotch of ivory or bone, about 7 inches long and
5 wide, is lashed between the gunwales where they meet at the bow. In
this the heavy harpoon rests when they are approaching a whale. It is
only used when whaling. The Museum collection contains specimens of this
sort from as far south as the Diomede Islands.</p>

<p>We brought home five specimens of these kû´nnɐ, of which No. 56510
[117] Fig. 347 has been selected as the type. This is made of two
bilaterally symmetrical pieces of white walrus ivory, each piece
consisting of one arm of the crotch and half the shank. Its total length
is 7.8 inches. The two pieces are held together by a stout wooden
tree-nail, and above this a lashing of sinew-braid, lodged in two deep
vertical channels one on each side of the shank just below the arms, and
wedged above and below on both sides with slips of wood. A&nbsp;hole is
drilled through each side of the butt close to the end, and through
these a lashing is stretched across the reentering angle of the butt
consisting of four turns of sinew braid with the end closely wrapped
round the parts between the holes, and neatly tucked in.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 347.&mdash;Ivory crotch for

</div>

<p>Just at the bend of each arm is a small round becket hole, running
obliquely from the back to the outer side. In each of these is a neat
becket, about ¾ inches long, made of several turns of sinew braid, with
the end neatly wrapped around them. These beckets serve to receive the
lashings for attaching the crotch to the gunwales. All the ornamental
figures are incised and blackened.</p>

<p>Three of the remaining four specimens are of walrus-ivory, and of
essentially the same pattern, differing only in ornamentation and other
minor details. No. 56511 [116], from Utkiavwĭñ, is almost exactly like
the type and of very nearly the same size. It is fastened together with
a lashing only, but no treenail, and the beckets have been removed from
the becket holes. The border is colored with red ocher, and there are
two whales’ tails instead of one on the shank. The other two have the
tips of the arms carved into the shape of whales’ heads. No. 89418
[1224], Fig. 348, from Utkiavwĭñ, is otherwise of the same shape as
those already described, but is lashed together with stout seal thong,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page342" id = "page342">
342</a></span>
and has four beckets of the same material, two in the usual position and
two at the widest part of the shank. These take the place of the loop
running across the butt. On the middle of the back of each arm is a
small cross incised and blackened with a small blue glass bead inlaid in
the center, and there are two whale’s tails on the opposite face of the
shank. It is 8 inches long.</p>

<p>No. 89419 [926], from Nuwŭk, has a nearly straight shank with a
flange on each side at the butt. It is lashed together with whalebone
and has also a treenail, like the type. The upper beckets are of
sinew-braid. A&nbsp;large becket at the butt is made by looping and
knotting the ends of a bit of thong into a hole in each flange. There is
one whale’s tail engraved on the front of the shank. When lashed in
position the front or ornamental side faces inboard, as is indicated by
the shape of the shank, which is slightly narrower behind than in front,
so as to fit between the converging gunwales. No. 8917 [1104], Fig. 349,
from Nuwuk, the only one of the kind seen, is a very interesting form.
It is made by cutting a horizontal slice out of the lower jaw of a
walrus, so that it form the arms of the crotch, while the thick
symphysis is cut into a shank of the usual shape, with the two upper
beckets in the usual place and a large one at the butt, passing through
a transverse hole. These beckets are roughly made of thong. Its total
length is 6.6 inches.</p>

<p>This specimen from its soiled condition is undoubtedly quite ancient,
and probably of an older type than the highly ornamented ivory crotches
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page343" id = "page343">
343</a></span>
of the present day. The latter are evidently only copies of the jawbone
crotch in a material susceptible of a higher finish than the coarse
bone. The only reason for making them in two pieces is that it is
impossible to get a single piece of walrus ivory large enough for a
whole one. It seems to me highly probable that the crotch was suggested
by the natural shape of the walrus jaw, since these are frequently used
for crotches to receive the cross pieces of the cache frames. Perhaps,
for a while, the whole jaw was simply lashed to the bow of the boat. The
next step would obviously be to cut out the shank and reduce the weight
of the crotch by trimming off the superfluous material. The reason for
making the crotch of ivory is perhaps purely esthetic; but more likely
connected with the notions already referred to which lead them to clean
up their boats and gear and adorn themselves and paint their faces when
they go to the whale fishery.</p>

<p>Although, as I have already stated, there appears to be no essential
difference in the general plan of the frame of the Greenland umiaks and
those used at Point Barrow, there seems to be considerable difference in
the size and outward appearance. As well as can be judged from the brief
descriptions and rude figures of various authors<a class = "tag" name =
"tag451" id = "tag451" href = "#note451">451</a> and various models in
the National Museum (the correctness of which, however, I&nbsp;can not
be sure of, without having seen the originals) the umiak not only in
Greenland, but among the Eskimo generally as far west as the Mackenzie,
is a much more wall sided square ended boat than at Point Barrow, having
less sheer to the gunwales with the stem and stern-post nearly
vertical.<a class = "tag" name = "tag452" id = "tag452" href =
"#note452">452</a> Mr. L.&nbsp;M. Turner informs me that this is the
case at Ungava Bay. It was also a larger boat. Egede says that they “are
large and open *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* some of them 20 yards long;”<a class =
"tag" name = "tag453" id = "tag453" href = "#note453">453</a> Crantz

at Ungava. Capt. Parry found no umiaks at Fury and Hecla straits<a class

Kumlien says that they are becoming rare at Cumberland Gulf. The
so-called Arctic Highlanders of Smith Sound have no boats of any kind.
The model used at Point Barrow probably prevails as far south as
Kotzebue Sound. The boats that boarded us off Wainwright Inlet in the
autumn of 1883, and those of the Nunatañmiun who visited Point Barrow,
seemed not to differ from those with which we were familiar, except that
the latter were rather light and low sided, nor do I remember anything
peculiar about the boats which we saw at Plover Bay in 1881.</p>

"tag457" id = "tag457" href = "#note457">457</a> and a few models in the
Museum, the Norton Sound umiak appears to have the gunwales united at
both stem and stern. Those that we saw at St. Michael’s in 1883, were so
much modified by Russian ideas as to be wholly out of the line of
comparison. The same is true of the Aleutian “baidara,” if, indeed, the
latter be an umiak at all.</p>

<p>Snowshoes of a very efficient pattern and very well made are now
universally employed at Point Barrow. Although the snow never lies very
deep on the ground, and is apt to pile up in hard drifts, it is
sufficiently deep and soft in many places, especially on the grassy
parts of the tundra, to make walking without snowshoes very inconvenient
and fatiguing. I&nbsp;have even seen them used on the sea ice for
crossing level spaces when a few inches of snow had fallen. Practically,
every man in the two villages, and many of the women and boys, have each
their own pair of snowshoes, fitted to their size. Each shoe consists of
a rim of light wood, bent into the shape of a pointed oval, about five
times as long as the greatest breadth, and much bent up at the rounded
end, which is the toe. The sides are braced apart by two stout
cross-bars (<i>toe</i> and <i>heel bar</i>) a little farther apart than
the length of the wearer’s foot. The space between these two bars is
netted in large meshes (<i>foot netting</i>) with stout thong for the
foot to rest upon, and the spaces at the ends are closely netted with
fine deerskin “babiche”<a class = "tag" name = "tag458" id = "tag458"
href = "#note458">458</a> (<i>toe</i> and <i>heel netting</i>). The
straps for the foot are fastened to the foot netting in such a way that
while the strap is firmly fastened round the ankle the snowshoe is slung
to the toe. The wearer walks with long swinging strides, lifting the toe
of the shoe at each step, while the tail or heel drags in the snow. The
straps are so contrived that the foot can be slipped in and out of them
without touching them with the fingers, a&nbsp;great advantage in cold
weather. When deer hunting, according to Lieut. Ray, they take a long
piece of thong and knot each end of it to the toe of one snowshoe. The
bight is then looped into the belt behind so that the snowshoes drag out
of the way of the heels. When they wish to put on the shoes they draw
them up, insert their feet in the straps, and fasten the slack of the
lines into the belt in front with a slip knot. When, however, they come
to a piece of ground where snowshoes are not needed, they kick them off,
slip the knots, and let them “drop astern.”</p>

<p>We brought home three pairs of snowshoes, which represent very well
the form in general use. No. 89912 [1736], Fig. 350, has been selected
as the type. The rim is of willow, 51 inches long and 10½ inches
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page345" id = "page345">
345</a></span>
wide at the broadest part, and is made of two strips about 1 inch thick
and ¾ wide, joined at the toe by a long lap-splice, held together by
four short horizontal or slightly oblique stitches of thong. Each strip
is elliptical in section, with the long axis vertical, and keeled on the
inner face, except between the bars. Each is tapered off considerably
from the toe bar to the toe, and slightly tapered toward the heel. The
two points are fastened together by a short horizontal stitch of
whalebone. The tip is produced into a slight “tail,” and the inner side
of each shoe is slightly straighter than the outer&mdash;that is to say,
they are “rights and lefts.”</p>

<div class = "figfloat">

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 350.&mdash;Snowshoe.</p>
</div>

<p>The bars are elliptical in section, flattened, and have their ends
mortised into the rim. They are about a foot apart, and of oak, the toe
bar 9.2 inches long and the heel bar 8.5. Both are of the same breadth
and thickness, 1&nbsp;by ½ inch. There is also an extra bar for
strengthening the back part of the shoe 10 inches from the point. It is
also of oak, 4.8 inches long, 0.5 wide, and 0.3 thick. The toe and heel
nettings are put on first. Small equidistant vertical holes run round
the inside of each space. Those in the rim are drilled through the keel
already mentioned, and joined by a shallow groove above and below; those
in the bars are about ½ inch from the edge and joined by a groove on the
under side of the toe bar only. Into these holes is laced a piece of
babiche, which is knotted once into each hole, making a series of
beckets about ¾ inch wide round the inside of the space. There are no
lacing holes in the parts spliced at the toe, but the lacing passes
through a bight of each stitch. At the toe bar the lacing is carried
straight across from rim to rim about three times, the last part being
wound round the others.</p>

<p>On the left shoe the end is brought back on the left-hand side,
passed through the first hole in the bar from above, carried along in
the groove on the underside to the next hole, up through this and round
the lacing, and back through the same hole, the two parts being twisted
together between the bar and lacing. This is continued, “stopping” the
lacing in festoons to the bar, to the last hole on the right,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page346" id = "page346">
346</a></span>
where it is finished off by knotting the end round the last “stop.” The
stops are made, apparently, by a separate piece on the right shoe. The
lacing on the heel bar is also double or triple, but the last part,
which is wound round the others, is knotted into each hole as on the
rim. The lacings on the rim of the heel space are knotted with a single
knot round each end of the extra bar.</p>

<p>In describing the nettings it will always be understood that the
upper surface of the shoe is toward the workman, with the point upward,
if describing the heel nettings, and vice versa for the toe. To begin
with the heel netting, which is the simpler: This is in two parts, one
from the heel bar to the extra bar (heel netting proper) and one from
the latter to the point (point netting). The netting is invariably
fastened to the lacing by passing the end through the becket from above
and bringing it back over itself. In making the point netting the end of
the babiche is knotted round the bar at the right-hand lower corner with
a single knot. The other end goes up to the lacing at the point and
comes down to the left-hand lower corner, where it is hitched round the
bar, as in Fig. 351, then goes up to the lowest becket on the left side,
crosses to the corresponding one on the right, and comes down and is
hitched as before round the bar inside of the starting point. This makes
a series of strands round the outside of the space, two running
obliquely from right to left, a&nbsp;long one on the right side and a
short one on the left side; two similar strands from left to right, the
long one on the left and the short one on the right, and one transverse
strand at the base of the triangle (see diagram, Fig. 352<i>a</i>). The
next round goes up to the first becket at the top on the left hand,
crosses to the corresponding one on the right, and then makes the same
strands as the first round, running parallel to them and about half an
inch nearer the center of the space (see diagram, Fig. 352<i>b</i>).
Each successive round follows the last, coming each time about ½ inch
nearer the center, till the space is all filled in, which brings the end
of the last round to the middle of the bar, round which it is knotted
with a single knot. This makes three sets of strands, two obliquely
longitudinal, one set from right to left and one from left to right, and
one transverse, all of each set parallel and equidistant, or nearly so,
and each interwoven alternately over and under each successive strand it
meets.</p>

</div>

<p>The right shoe has fourteen longitudinal strands in each set and
thirteen transverse; the left, one less in each set. On the left shoe
the end is carried up from the last knot to the lacing at the point, and
then comes back to the bar, fastening the other part to the netting with
six equidistant half-hitches. The heel netting proper is put on in a
slightly
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page347" id = "page347">
347</a></span>
different fashion, as the space to be filled is no longer triangular. It
starts as before in the right hand lower corner, where it is knotted
into the becket, running across from the rim to the heel-bar; goes up to
the middle of the extra bar, round which it is hitched as already
described, then down to the left hand lower corner; up to the first
becket on the left rim, across to the corresponding one on the right,
and down to the first becket on the heel bar. This completes the first
round (see diagram, Fig. 353<i>a</i>). The second round goes up to the
hind bar at the left of the first, comes down only to the transverse
strand of the first round on the left, goes up to the becket on the rim
above the first, crosses to the right, and comes back to the transverse
turn of the first rounds. All these strands except the transverse one
are on the left of the first round. The third round follows the first,
which brings all its strands except the transverse one to the right of
the first round (see diagram, Fig. 353<i>b</i>). The successive odd
rounds follow the first and the even rounds the second, bringing the
longitudinal strands alternately to the right and left of the first
round, until the ends of the hind bar are reached&mdash;that is to say,
till the space <i>outside</i> of the first round is filled&mdash;each
transverse strand coming above the preceding. This is done regularly on
the left shoe, the tenth round coming to the left end of the bar, and
the eleventh to the right. The twelfth round comes to the becket in the
left hand upper corner, and crosses to the corresponding becket on the
other side. It then follows the odd rounds, thus making six strands,
four longitudinal and two transverse, as in the point nettings. All the
remaining rounds follow this till the whole space is filled in, which
brings the end of the last round to the middle of the heel bar, where it
is knotted to the becket.</p>

eighth round, which obliged him to alter the order of the other strands
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page348" id = "page348">
348</a></span>
and finish with half a round. Instead of taking the end of the eighth
round down to the preceding transverse strand only, he has brought it
down to the heel bar, which brings the ninth round to the left,
following the even rounds, and coming to the end of the hind bar, the
tenth to the right end of the bar, so that it is the eleventh which
makes the first transverse turn at the top. The pattern is the same as
in the point nettings. The right shoe has 25, 24, and 19 strands in the
three sets respectively, and the left, 25, 25, and 19. The toe nettings
are put on in the same way, the first round going to the middle becket
at the toe, and crossing to the first becket on the right hand, the
second going to the first becket on the left hand and crossing on the
right to the first round, and the third going to the first round at the
toe and crossing on the right to the becket.</p>

<p>All the even rounds go to the becket at the toe and cross to the
preceding even round, and all the odd rounds go to the preceding odd
round at the toe and cross to the becket, until the space outside of the
first round is filled with longitudinal strands, when they begin to make
descending transverse turns across the toe, going from the becket on the
left to the corresponding one on the right and thus following the odd
rounds. The fourteenth round on the right shoe begins this, the twelfth
on the left. This brings the end of the last round to the middle of the
toe bar. It is then carried up to the becket at the toe, brought down
and up again, and the end is used to fasten these three parts to the
netting with equidistant half hitches&mdash;fourteen on the right shoe
and thirteen on the left. The pattern, of course, is the same as before,
with 33, 33, and 26 strands on the right shoe, and 31, 31, and 25 on the
left, in each set respectively.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page349" id = "page349">
349</a></span>
<p>The foot-netting is of a very different pattern, and consists of
seven transverse and thirteen longitudinal strands, of which six, in the
middle, do not reach the toe bar, leaving an oblong transverse hole,
through which the toe presses against the snow at the beginning of the
step. The cross strands are a piece of stout thong (the skin of the
walrus or bearded seal), to the end of which is spliced with double
slits a long piece of thinner seal thong, which makes the longitudinal
ones. The seven transverse strands pass in and out through holes in the
rim, while the longitudinal strands pass over the bars, except the
middle three pairs, which pass round the horizontal strand behind the
toe hole, drawing it down to the next strand. The end of the thirteenth
strand wattles these two firmly together, as it does also the two pairs
of longitudinal strands on each side of the toe hole, and finishes off
the netting by whipping the two sets of strands together with a
“birdcage stitch.”</p>

<p>The object of the complicated wattling round the toe hole is, first,
to strengthen the hind border against which the toe presses in walking,
and second to give a firm attachment for the straps, which are fastened
at the junction of the doubled and twisted longitudinal strands with the
first and second transverse ones. Each strap is a single piece of stout
seal thong fastened to the shoe with two loops as follows: At the inner
side of the shoe the end is passed into the toe hole and makes a round
turn about the doubled longitudinal strands, and then goes under the two
cross strands, coming out behind them and between the twelfth and
thirteenth longitudinal strands. It is then spliced into the standing
part with two slits, making a becket about 3 inches in diameter. The
other end, leaving a loop large enough to go round the wearer’s heel, is
passed through the becket just made, wound in the same way as before
round the strands at the other corner of the toe hole, and made into a
similar becket by knotting the end to the standing part with a
marlinghitch with the bight left in. On the right shoe this hitch is
made in a slit in the standing part. The end is probably left long for
the purpose of adjusting the length of the strap to the wearer’s
foot.</p>

<p>In putting on the shoe, the toe is thrust sideways through the loop
till the bight comes well up over the heel, and then turned round and
stuck under the two beckets, which together form a strap to fasten the
toe down to the shoe, leaving the latter free to swing when the heel is
raised. By reversing the process the shoe is easily kicked off. These
straps must be fitted very nicely or else the shoe is apt to come off.
This is a very neatly made pair of shoes, and the woodwork is all
painted red above.</p>

<p>No. 89913 [1737] is a pair of similar shoes also from Utkiavwĭñ. The
frame is made in the same way and is wholly of willow except the extra
hind bar, which is of walrus ivory. These shoes are shorter and somewhat
broader than the preceding and not so well made. They are 48.5
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page350" id = "page350">
350</a></span>
inches long and 11 broad. The two shoes are not perceptibly different in
shape. The lacing, which is of sinew braid, is put on in the same way as
on the preceding pair, except that it is fastened directly into the
holes on the toe bars. The whole of the heel netting is in one piece,
and made precisely in the same way as the point nettings of the first
pair, the end being carried up the middle to the point of the heel and
brought down again to the bar as on the toe nettings, but fastened with
marling hitches. The number of strands is the same in each shoe,
twenty-three in each set. The toe nettings follow quite regularly the
pattern of the preceding pair.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 354.&mdash;Small snowshoe.</p>
</div>

<p>The shoes are not quite the same size, as the right has 35, 35, and
28 strands, and the left 33, 33, and 25, in each set respectively. There
is no regular rule about the number of strands in any part of the
netting, the object being simply to make the meshes always about the
same size. The foot netting is made of stout and very white thong from
the bearded seal. These shoes have no strings.</p>

<p>No. 89914 [1738] is a pair of rather small shoes from Utkiavwĭñ, one
of which is shown in Fig. 354. They are rights and lefts, and are 42
inches long by 10 broad. The frame is wholly of oak, and differs from
the type only in having no extra hind bar, and having the heel and toe
bars about equal in length. The points are fastened together with a
treenail, as well as with a whalebone stitch. The heel-nettings are put
on with perfect regularity, as on the pair last described, but the
toe-nettings, though they start in the usual way, do not follow any
regular rule of sucession, the rounds being put on sometimes inside and
sometimes outside of the preceding, till the whole space is filled. The
foot-nettings are somewhat clumsily made, especially on the right shoe,
which appears to have been broken in several places, and “cobbled” by an
unskillful workman. There are only five transverse strands which are
double on the left shoe, and the longitudinal strands are not whipped to
these, but interwoven, and each pair twisted together between the
transverse strands. There is no wattling back of the toe hole, and one
pair of longitudinal strands at the side of the latter is not doubled on
the left shoe. The strings are put on as on the type except that the
ends are knotted instead of being spliced. This pair of shoes was
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page351" id = "page351">
351</a></span>
used by the writer on many short excursions around the station during
the winters of 1881-’82 and 1882-’83. They were old when purchased.</p>

<p>I had but one opportunity of seeing the process of making the frames
of the snowshoes. Ilûbw’ga, the “inland” native frequently mentioned,
a&nbsp;particularly skillful workman, undertook to make a pair of
snowshoes for Lieut. Ray at our quarters, but did not succeed in
finishing them, as the ash lumber which we brought from San Francisco
proved too brittle for the purpose. Having a long piece of wood, he “got
out” the whole rim in one piece. Ordinarily the splice at the toe must
be made, at least temporarily, before the frame can be bent into shape.
He softened up the wood by wrapping it in rags wet with hot water. Some
of the other natives, however, recommended that the wood should be
immersed in the salt water for a day or two, from which I infer that
this is a common practice. After slowly bending the toe, with great
care, nearly into shape, he inserted into the bend a flat block of wood
of the proper shape for the toe and lashed the frame to this.
A&nbsp;pointed block was also used to give the proper shape to the heel;
the bars being inserted in the mortises before the ends were brought
together. The temporary lashings are kept on till the wood dries into
shape. The toes are turned up by tying the shoes together, sole to sole,
and inserting a transverse stick between the tips of the toes.</p>

<p>The use of finely finished snowshoes of this pattern is of
comparatively recent date at Point Barrow. Dr. Simpson<a class = "tag"
name = "tag459" id = "tag459" href = "#note459">459</a> is explicit
concerning the use of snowshoes in his time (1853-’55). He says:
“Snowshoes are so seldom used in the north where the drifted snow
presents a hard frozen surface to walk upon, that certainly not half a
dozen pairs were in existence at Point Barrow at the time of our
arrival, and those were of an inferior sort.” I&nbsp;have already
mentioned the universal employment of these snowshoes at the present
day, so that the custom must have arisen in the last thirty years. The
pattern of shoe now used is identical with those of the Tinné or
Athabascan Indians (as&nbsp;is plainly shown by the National Museum
collections), and I am inclined to believe that the Point Barrow natives
have learned to use them from the “Nunatañmiun,” from whom, indeed, they
purchase ready-made snowshoes at the present day, as we ourselves
observed. The “Nunatañmiun,” or the closely related people of the Kuwûk
River, are known to have intimate trading relations with the Indians,
and even in Simpson’s time<a class = "tag" name = "tag460" id = "tag460"
href = "#note460">460</a> used the Indian shoe, sometimes at least. The
fact that in recent times families of the “Nunatañmiun” have established
the habit of spending the winter with the people of Point Barrow and
associating with them in the winter deer-hunt, would explain how the
latter came to recognize the superior excellence of the Indian shoe.</p>

<p>This is more likely than that they learned to use them from the
eastern natives, whom they only meet for a short time in summer, though
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page352" id = "page352">
352</a></span>
the latter used the Indian style of snowshoes at least as early as 1826.
Franklin<a class = "tag" name = "tag461" id = "tag461" href =
"#note461">461</a> speaks of seeing, at Demarcation Point, a&nbsp;pair
of snowshoes netted with cords of deerskin and shaped like those of the
Indians of the Mackenzie.</p>

<p>Most of the other Eskimo of Alaska, who need to use snowshoes at all,
use a style of shoe very much less efficient and more roughly made, the
rim being of heavy, rather crooked pieces of willow or alder. Simpson’s
description will apply very well to this form, which is used even as far
north as Icy Cape, whence Mr. Nelson brought home a pair. It also
appears to be the prevailing, if not the only, form on the Siberian
coast and St. Lawrence Island, judging from Nordinskiöld’s figure<a
class = "tag" name = "tag462" id = "tag462" href = "#note462">462</a>
and Mr. Nelson’s collections.</p>

<p>Simpson says:<a class = "tag" name = "tag463" id = "tag463" href =
"#note463">463</a> “The most common one is two pieces of alder, about
two feet and a half long, curved towards each other at the ends, where
they are bound together, and kept apart in the middle by two
crosspieces, each end of which is held in a mortise. Between the
crosspieces is stretched a stout thong, lengthwise and across, for the
foot to rest upon, with another which first forms a loop to allow the
toes to pass beneath; this is carried round the back of the ankle to the
opposite side of the foot, so as to sling the snowshoe under the joint
of the great toe.”</p>

<p>When there are toe and heel nettings, they are of seal thong with a
large open mesh. The snowshoe from Norton Sound, figured by Dall,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag464" id = "tag464" href = "#note464">464</a> is
a rather neatly made variety of this form. South of the Yukon, the use
of the snowshoe appears to be confined to the Indians. As shown by the
Museum collections, the strings are always of the pattern described
throughout the whole northwestern region.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag465" id = "tag465" href = "#note465">465</a></p>

<p>Snowshoes appear to be rarely used among the eastern Eskimo. The only
writer who mentions them is Kumlien.<a class = "tag" name = "tag466" id
= "tag466" href = "#note466">466</a> He says: “When traveling over the
frozen wastes in winter, they [i.e., the natives of Cumberland Gulf] use
snowshoes. These are half-moon shaped, of whalebone, with sealskin
thongs tightly drawn across. They are about 16 inches long. Another
pattern is merely a frame of wood, about the same length and 8 or 10
inches wide, with sealskin thongs for the foot to rest on.”</p>

<p>The latter is apparently quite like the western snowshoes described
by Simpson.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "transport_foot_staff" id =

<p>The only staff used by the young and vigorous is the shaft of the
spear, when one is carried. The aged and feeble, however, support their
steps with one or two staffs about 5 feet long, often shod with bone or
ivory. (The old man whom Franklin met on the Coppermine River walked

<p>The only land conveyance employed at Point Barrow is the universal
sledge of the Eskimo, of which there are two forms in general use, one,
kă´motĭ, with a high rail on each side, and especially intended for
carrying loads of the smaller articles, clothing, camp equipage, etc.,
and the other (unia) low and flat, without rail or “upstander,” for
carrying bulky objects, like whole carcasses of deer, frozen seals,
rough dried deerskins, etc., and especially used for carrying the umiak
across the land or solid ice. Both kinds are made without nails, but are
fastened together by mortises and lashings and stitches of thong and
whalebone. I&nbsp;have, however, seen one unia, which was made in 1883,
fastened together with nails, a&nbsp;rather inferior substitute for the
lashings, as they not only would not hold so firmly, but would also be
liable to break in cold weather.</p>

<p>Both kinds of sledge are made of driftwood and shod with strips of
whale’s jaw, about three-fourths of an inch thick, fastened on with bone
treenails. These bone runners, which are about 2 inches wide, run
sufficiently well over ice, hard snow, the frozen gravel of the beach or
even on the bare tundra, but for carrying a heavy load over the softer
snow of the interior they are shod with ice in a manner peculiar to this
region.</p>

<p>It is well known that not only the Eskimo generally, but other
hyperborean people coat the runners of their sleds with ice to make them
run more smoothly, but this is usually only a comparatively thin crust,
produced by pouring water on the runners or applying a mixture of snow
or mud and water.<a class = "tag" name = "tag468" id = "tag468" href =
"#note468">468</a> Mr. Turner informs me that at Ungava they are
particular to use fine black vegetable mold for this purpose.</p>

<p>The method at Point Barrow is quite different from this. To each
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page354" id = "page354">
354</a></span>
runner is fitted a heavy shoe of clear ice, as long as the runner, and
fully 1 foot high by 6 inches thick. The sledge with these ice runners
is estimated to weigh, even when unloaded, upwards of 200 or 300 pounds,
but it appears that the smoothness of running more than counterbalances
the extra weight. At any rate these shoes are almost universally
employed on the sleds which make the long journey from the rivers in the
spring with heavy loads of meat, fish, and skins. One native, in 1883,
shod his sledges with salt-water ice in this way before starting for the
hunting grounds. As these ice shoes are usually put on at the rivers,
I&nbsp;had no opportunity of seeing the process, though I have seen the
sledges thus shod after their return to the village. Lieut. Ray, who saw
the process, describes it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
“From the ice on a pond that is free from fracture they cut the pieces
the length of a sled runner, 8&nbsp;inches thick and 10 inches wide;
into these they cut a groove deep enough to receive the sled runner up
to the beam; the sled is carefully fitted into the groove, and secured
by pouring in water, a&nbsp;little at a time and allowing it to freeze.
Great care is taken in this part of the operation, for should the
workman apply more than a few drops at a time, the slab of ice would be
split and the work all to do over again; after the ice is firmly secured
the sled is turned bottom up and the ice-shoe is carefully rounded with
a knife, and then smoothed by wetting the naked hand and passing it over
the surface until it becomes perfectly glazed.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag469" id = "tag469" href = "#note469">469</a></blockquote>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 356.&mdash;Railed sledge,
diagrammatic (from photograph).</p>

<p>In traveling they take great care of these runners, keeping them
smooth and polished, and mending all cracks by pouring in fresh water.
They are also careful to shade them from the noonday sun, which at this
season of the year is warm enough to loosen the shoes, for this purpose
hanging a cloth or skin over the sunny side of the sled.<a class = "tag"

<p>We were unfortunately not able to bring home specimens of either
style of large sled. The rail sled (kămotĭ) is usually about 8 or 9 feet
long, and 2½ to 3 feet wide, and the rail at the back not over 2½ feet
high. The thick curved runners, about 5 or 6 inches wide (see diagram,
Fig. 356,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page355" id = "page355">
355</a></span>
made from a small photograph) meet the curved slender rails (which are
usually round) in front, but are separated from them behind by four
stout vertical posts on each side, increasing in length toward the other
end and mortised into the runners and rails. An equal number of stout
wooden arches half the height of the posts are mortised into the
runners, each arch a little in front of each pair of posts.
A&nbsp;longitudinal strip runs along the middle of each side, and slats
are laid across these, supported by the arches. The sledge is rather
heavy and clumsy, but usually carefully made and often painted with red
ocher.</p>

<p>Of the unia or flat sledge we have, fortunately a good photograph,
Fig. 357. To the thick straight wooden runners are fastened directly
seven cross slats, which project about 2 inches at each end beyond the
runner, to which they are fastened by two stitches of whalebone each.
A&nbsp;longitudinal strip runs along above the slats on each side. These
sledges are generally made on the same pattern, varying somewhat in
size. A&nbsp;common size is about 6 feet long, about 2½ feet wide, and 9
or 10 inches high. Very small sledges of this pattern are sometimes
made, especially for the purpose, as we were told, of carrying
provisions, perhaps when one or two persons desire to make a rapid
journey of some length, or for carrying a small share of meat from camp
to camp.<a class = "tag error" name = "tag471" id = "tag471" href =

runners.</p>

<p>One of these (Fig. 358, No. 89889 [1140], from Utkiavwĭñ), which
shows signs of long use, was brought home. It is 20.7 inches long and 13
broad, and has ivory runners, with three wooden slats across them, held
down
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page356" id = "page356">
356</a></span>
by a low wooden rail on each side. Each runner is a slice from a single
large walrus tusk, with the butt at the back of the sled. The slats,
which are pieces of a ship’s paneling, are lashed to the upper edge of
the runners so as to project about one-half inch on each side. The rails
flare slightly outward. The whole is fastened together by lashings of
rather broad whalebone, passing through a hole near the upper edge of
the runner, a&nbsp;notch in the end of the slat and a hole in the slat
inside of the rail. There are two lashings at each end of each broad
slat and one in the middle, at each end of the narrow one. The last and
the ones at each end of the sled also secure the rail by passing through
a hole near its edge, in which are cut square notches to make room for
the other lashings. The trace is a strip of seal thong about 5 feet long
and one-fourth inch wide, split at one end for about 1 foot into two
parts. The other end is slit in two for about 3 inches. This is probably
a broken loop, which served for fastening the trace to a dog’s
harness.</p>

<p>I do not recollect ever seeing so small a sled in actual use, though
Lieut. Ray says he has frequently seen them drawn by one dog. The people
who came down from Nuwŭk with a small load of things for trade sometimes
used a small unía about 3 feet long, with one dog, and the same was
often used by the girls for bringing in firewood from the beach.</p>

<p>A very peculiar sled was formerly used at Point Barrow, but we have
no means of knowing how common it was. It was a sort of toboggan, made
by lashing together lengthwise slabs of whalebone, but is now wholly
obsolete, since whalebone has too high a market value to permit of its
being used for any such purpose. We obtained one specimen about 10 feet
long, but it was unfortunately in such a dilapidated condition that we
were unable to bring it home. I&nbsp;find no previous mention of the use
of such sleds by any Eskimo. It is not necessary to suppose that this
sled is modeled after the toboggan of the Hudson Bay voyagers, of which
these people might have obtained knowledge through the eastern natives,
since the simple act of dragging home a “slab” of whalebone would
naturally suggest this contrivance.</p>

<p>We did bring home one small sled of this kind (No. 89875 [772], Fig.
359, from Utkiavwĭñ), which from its size was probably a child’s toy,
though from its greasy condition it seems to have been used for dragging
pieces of blubber. It is made of the tips of 6 small “slabs” of black
whalebone, each about 2 inches wide at the broad end, and put together
side by side so as to form a triangle 19¼ inches long and 9¾ wide, the
apex being the front of the sled, and the left-hand edge of each slab
slightly overlapping the edge of the preceding. They are fastened
together by three transverse bands, passing through loops in the upper
surface of each slot, made by cutting two parallel longitudinal slits
about one-half inch long and one-fourth inch apart part way through, and
raising up the surface between them. The hindmost band is a strip of
whalebone nearly one-half inch wide, passing through these
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page357" id = "page357">
357</a></span>
loops, and wound closely in a spiral around a straight rod of whalebone,
0.4 inch wide and 0.1 inch thick, as long as the band. The ends of the
band are knotted into rings or beckets about 2¼ inches in diameter. The
other two bands are simple, narrow strips of whalebone, running straight
across through the loops and knotted at the ends into similar beckets.
These beckets were obviously for tying on the load.</p>

<p>The sled with side rails does not appear to be used east of the
Mackenzie region, but is found only slightly modified at least as far
south as Norton Sound.<a class = "tag" name = "tag472" id = "tag472"

"tag" name = "tag474" id = "tag474" href = "#note474">474</a> The sleds
of the eastern Eskimo vary somewhat in pattern and material, but may be
described in general terms as essentially the same as the unía, but
usually provided with what is called an “upstander,” namely, two upright
posts at each side of the back of the sled, often connected by a cross
rail, which serve to guide the sled from behind. Many descriptions and
figures of these sleds will be found in the various descriptions of the
eastern Eskimo.</p>

<p>These sledges are drawn by dogs, which, as far as I am able to judge,
are of the same breed as those used by the eastern Eskimo. They are, as
a rule, rather large and stout. A&nbsp;number of the dogs at Utkiavwĭñ
would compare favorably in size with the average Newfoundland dogs, and
they appear to be capable of well sustained exertion. The commonest
color is the regular “brindle” of the wolf, though white,
brindle-and-white, and black-and-white dogs are not uncommon. There was,
however, but one wholly black dog in the two villages. This was a very
handsome animal known by the name of Allúa (“coal”).</p>

<p>Every dog has his name and knows it. Their disposition is rather
quarrelsome, especially among themselves, but they are not particularly
ferocious, seldom doing more than howl and yelp at a stranger, and it is
not difficult usually to make friends with them. There was
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page358" id = "page358">
358</a></span>
very little difficulty in petting the half dozen dogs which we had at
the station, and they grew to be very much attached to the laborer who
used to feed them. The natives treat their dogs well as a rule, seldom
beating them wantonly or severely. Though they do not allow them to come
into the houses, the dogs seem to have considerable attachment to their
masters. Considerable care is bestowed on the puppies. Those born in
winter are frequently reared in the iglu, and the women often carry a
young puppy around in the jacket as they would a child.</p>

<p>We saw no traces of the disease resembling hydrophobia, which has
wrought such havoc in Greenland and Baffin Land. I&nbsp;once, however,
saw a puppy apparently suffering from fits of some kind, running wildly
round and round, yelping furiously, and occasionally rolling over and
kicking. The natives said, “Mûlukû´lĭrua, asi´rua”, (“He is
howling[?];<a class = "tag" name = "tag475" id = "tag475" href =
"#note475">475</a> he is bad”), and some of the boys finally took it out
on the tundra and knocked it on the head.</p>

<p>The dog harness, ánun (Gr. anut), consists of a broad strip of stout
rawhide (from the bearded seal or walrus), with three parallel loops at
one end, frequently made by simply cutting long slits side by side in
the thong and bending it into shape. The head is passed through the
middle loop and a foreleg through each of the side-loops, bringing the
main part of the thong over the back. This serves as a trace, and is
furnished at the end with a toggle of bone or wood, by which it is
fastened to beckets in a long line of thong, the end of which is usually
made fast to the middle of the first slat of the sledge. The dogs are
attached in a long line, alternately on opposite sides of this trace,
just so far apart that one dog can not reach his leader when both are
pulling.</p>

<p>The most spirited dog is usually put at the head of the line as
leader, and the natives sometimes select a bitch in heat for this
position, as the dogs are sure to follow her. The same custom has been
observed by Kumlien at Cumberland Gulf.<a class = "tag" name = "tag476"
id = "tag476" href = "#note476">476</a> Ten dogs are considered a large
team, and few of the natives can muster so many. When the sledge is
heavily loaded men and women frequently help to drag it. The dogs are
never <i>driven</i>, and except over a well known trail, like that
between Utkiavwĭñ and the whaling camp in 1883, will not travel unless a
woman trots along in front, encouraging them with cries of “Añ! añ!
tû´lla! <ins class = "correction" title =
"close quotemissing">tû´lla!”</ins> (Come! come&nbsp;on!), while the man or woman
who runs behind the sled to guide it and keep it from capsizing, urges
them on with cries of “Kŭ! <ins class = "correction" title =
"closequote missing">kŭ!”</ins> (Get on! get&nbsp;on!), occasionally reproving
an individual dog by name. After they are well started, they go on
without much urging if nothing distracts their attention. It is not easy
to stop a dog team when the destination is reached. Commands and shouts
of “Lie down!” are seldom sufficient, and the people generally have to
pull
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page359" id = "page359">
359</a></span>
back on the sled and drag back on the harness till the team comes to a
halt.</p>

<p>The leader, who is usually a woman or child sometimes guides the team
by a line attached to the trace, and Lieut. Ray says he has seen them,
when traveling in the interior, tie a piece of blubber or meat on the
end of a string and drag it on the snow just ahead of the leader. The
natives seldom ride on the sledge except with a light load on a smooth
road. A&nbsp;few old and decrepit people like Yû´ksĭña always traveled
on sledges between the villages, and the people who came down with empty
sledges for provisions from the whaling camp, always rode on the well
beaten trail where the dogs would run without leading.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag477" id = "tag477" href = "#note477">477</a> The dog whip so
universally employed by the eastern Eskimo, is not used at Point Barrow,
but when Lieut. Ray made a whip for driving his team, the natives called
it ĭpirau´ta, a&nbsp;name essentially identical with that used in the
east. They especially distinguished ĭpirau´ta, a&nbsp;whip with a lash,
from a cudgel, anau´ta. The latter word has also the same meaning in the
eastern dialects.</p>

<p>We saw nothing of the custom of protecting the dogs’ feet with
sealskin shoes, so prevalent on the Siberian coast.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag478" id = "tag478" href = "#note478">478</a> Curiously enough the
only other localities in which the use of this contrivance is mentioned
are in the extreme east.<a class = "tag" name = "tag479" id = "tag479"
href = "#note479">479</a> During the first warm weather in the spring,
before the dogs have shed their heavy winter coats, they suffer a great
deal from the heat and can go only a short distance without lying down
to rest.</p>

<p>The method of harnessing and driving the dogs varies considerably in
different localities. Among the eastern natives the dogs are usually
harnessed abreast, each with a separate trace running to the sledge, and
the driver generally rides, guiding the dogs with a whip. The leader
usually has a longer trace than the rest. The harness used at Fury and
Hecla Straits is precisely the same as that at Point Barrow, but in
Greenland, according to Dr. Kane, it consists of a “simple
breast-strap,” with a single trace. The illustration, however, in Rink’s
Tales and Traditions, opposite p.&nbsp;232, which was drawn by a native
Greenlander, shows a pattern of harness similar to that used in Siberia
and described by Nordenskiöld<a class = "tag" name = "tag480" id =
"tag480" href = "#note480">480</a> as “made of inch-wide straps of skin,
forming a neck or shoulder band, united on both sides by a strap to a
girth, to one side of which the draft strap is fastened.” It is a
curious fact that the two extremes of the Eskimo race (for even if the
people of Pitlekaj be Chukchi in blood, they are Eskimo in culture)
should use the same pattern of harness, while a different form prevails
between them. The Siberians also habitually ride upon the sledges, and
use a whip, and on some parts of the coast, at least, harness the dogs
abreast. In
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page360" id = "page360">
360</a></span>
the region about Pitlekaj, however, the dogs are harnessed “tandem” in
pairs, as is the case at Norton Sound, where a more efficient harness is
also used, which is probably not Eskimo, but learned from the whites.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag481" id = "tag481" href = "#note481">481</a>
Nordenskiöld<a class = "tag" name = "tag482" id = "tag482" href =
"#note482">482</a> expresses the opinion that the Eskimo method of
harnessing the dogs abreast indicates that the Eskimos have lived longer
than the Chukchis north of the limit of trees; in other words, that the
method of harnessing the dogs tandem is the older one, and that the
Eskimo have learned to harness them abreast since they left the woodland
regions. I&nbsp;can hardly agree with these conclusions, for it seems to
me that the easiest and most natural method of attaching the dogs would
be to fasten each directly to the sled by its own trace. Now, when many
dogs are attached to the sled in this way, the outer dogs can not apply
their strength in a direct line but must pull obliquely, and, moreover,
as we know to be the case, so many long traces are constantly becoming
entangled, and each individual dog has to be kept straight by the
driver. If, however, the dogs be made fast to a long line, one behind
the other, not only does each pull straight ahead, but if the leader be
kept to the track he pulls the other dogs after him, relieving the
driver of the greater part of the care of them.</p>

<p>It seems to me therefore, that the tandem method is an improvement in
dog harnessing, which has been adopted only by the natives of
northeastern Siberia, and northwestern America, and has no connection
with the wooded or unwooded state of the country.<a class = "tag" name =

<h4><a name = "scores" id = "scores" href = "#top">HUNTING
SCORES.</a></h4>

<p>The only thing that we saw of the nature of numerical records were
the series of animals engraved upon ivory, already alluded to. In most
cases we were unable to learn whether the figures really represented an
actual record or not, though the bag handle, No. 89424 [890] already
figured, was said to contain the actual score of whales killed by old
Yú´ksĭña. The custom does not appear to be so prevalent as at Norton
Sound (see above, <a href =
"PointBarrow1.html#page117">p.&nbsp;117</a>). Many of these possible
scores being engraved on ivory implements have already been described.
With one exception they only record the capture of whales or reindeer.
The exception (No.&nbsp;89425 [1732], Fig. 153<i>b</i>) presents a
series of ten bearded seals. The reindeer are usually depicted in a
natural attitude, and some of the circumstances of the hunt are usually
represented. For instance, a&nbsp;man is figured aiming with a bow and
arrow toward <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘a / a’ atline break">a</ins> line of reindeer, indicating that such a number were
taken by shooting, while a string of deer, represented without legs as
they would
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page361" id = "page361">
361</a></span>
appear swimming, followed by a rude figure of a man in a kaiak, means
that so many were lanced in the water. Other incidents of the excursion
are also sometimes represented. On these records the whale is always
represented by a rude figure of the tail cut off at the “small,” and
often represented as hanging from a horizontal line.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 360.&mdash;Hunting score engraved
on ivory.</p>

<p>We also brought home four engraved pieces of ivory, which are nothing
else than records of real or imaginary scenes. I&nbsp;have figured all
of these. Fig. 360 (No.&nbsp;89487 [1026] from Nuwŭk) is a narrow flat
tablet of ivory, 4.8 inches long and 1 inch wide, with a string at one
end to hang it up by. On each face is an ornamental border inclosing a
number of incised figures, which probably represent actual scenes, as
the tablet is not new.</p>

<p>The figures on the obverse face are colored with red ocher. At the
upper end, standing on a cross line, with his head toward the end, is a
rudely drawn man, holding his right hand up and his left down, with the
fingers outspread. At his left stands a boy with both hands down. These
figures probably represent the hunter and his son. Just below the cross
line is a man raising a spear to strike an animal which is perhaps meant
for a reindeer without horns. Three deer, also without horns, stand with
their feet on one border with their heads toward the upper end, and on
the other border near the other end are two bucks with large antlers
heading the other way, and behind them a man in a kaiak. Between him and
the animal which the first man is spearing is an object which may
represent the crescent moon. The story may perhaps be freely translated
as follows: “When the moon was young the man and his son killed six
reindeer, two of them bucks with large antlers. One they speared on
land, the rest they chased with the kaiak.”</p>

<p>On the reverse the figures and border are colored black with soot. In
the left-hand lower corner is a she bear and her cub heading to the
left, followed by a man who is about to shoot an arrow at them. Then
come two more bears heading toward the right, and in the right-hand
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page362" id = "page362">
362</a></span>
lower corner is a whale with two floats attached to him by a harpoon
line. Above this is an umiak with four men in it approaching another
whale which has already received one harpoon with its two floats. The
harpoon which is to be thrust at him may be seen sticking out over the
bow of the boat. Then come two whales in a line, one heading to the left
and one to the right. In the left-hand upper corner is a figure which
may represent a boat, bottom up, on the staging of four posts. We did
not learn the actual history of this tablet, which was brought down for
sale with a number of other things.</p>

<p>Fig. 361 (No. 89473 [1349] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a piece of an old
snow-shovel edge with freshly incised figures on both faces, which the
artist said represented his own record. The figures are all colored with
red ocher. On the obverse the figures all stand on a roughly drawn
ground line. At the left is a man pointing his rifle at a bear, which
stands on its hind legs facing him. Then comes a she bear walking toward
the left followed by a cub, then two large bears also walking to the
left, and a she bear in the same attitude, followed by two cubs, one
behind the other. This was explained by the artist as follows: “These
are all the bears I have killed. This one alone (pointing to the
‘rampant’ one) was bad. All the others were good.” We heard at the time
of his giving the death shot to the last bear as it was charging his
comrade, who had wounded it with his muzzle-loader. On the reverse, the
figures are in the same position. The same man points his rifle at a
string of three wolves. His explanation was: “These are the wolves I
have killed.”</p>

<p>Fig. 362 (No. 89474 [1334] from Utkiavwĭñ) is newly made, but was
said to be the record of a man of our acquaintance named Mûñĭñolu. It is
a flat piece of the outside of a walrus tusk 9.7 inches long and 1.8
wide at the broader end. The figures are incised on one face only, and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page363" id = "page363">
363</a></span>
colored with red ocher. The face is divided lengthwise into two panels
by a horizontal line. In the upper panel, at the left, is a man facing
to the right and pointing a gun at a line of three standing deer, facing
toward the left. Two are bucks and one a doe. Then come two bucks,
represented without legs, as if swimming in the water, followed by a
rude figure of a man in a kaiak. Below the line at the left is an umiak
with five men, and then a row of twelve conventionalized whales’ tails,
of which all but the first, second, and fifth are joined to the
horizontal line by a short straight line. The record may be freely
translated as follows: “I&nbsp;went out with my gun and killed three
large reindeer, two bucks and a doe. I&nbsp;also speared two large bucks
in the water. My whaling crew have taken twelve whales.” The number of
whales is open to suspicion, as they just fill up the board.</p>

<p>Fig. 363 (No. 56517 [121] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a piece of an old
snow-shovel edge 4.2 inches long, with a loop of thong at the upper side
to hang it up by. It is covered on both faces with freshly incised
figures, colored with red ocher, representing some real or imaginary
occurrence.</p>

<p>The obverse is bordered with a single narrow line. At the left is a
man standing with arms outstretched supporting himself by two slender
staffs as long as he is. In the middle are three rude figures of tents,
very high and slender. At the right is a hornless reindeer heading to
the left, with a man standing on its back with his legs straddled
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page364" id = "page364">

apart and his arms uplifted. On the reverse, there is no border, but a
single dog and a man who supports himself with a long staff are dragging
an empty rail sledge toward the left.</p>

<p>I find no mention of the use of any such scores among the eastern
Eskimo, but they are very common among those of the west, as shown by
the Museum collections. They record in this way, not only hunting
exploits but all sorts of trivial occurrences.</p>

<p>These people have only one game which appears to be of the nature of
gambling. It is played with the twisters and marline spikes used for
backing the bow, and already described, though Lieut. Ray says he has
seen it played with any bits of stick or bone. I&nbsp;never had an
opportunity of watching a game of this sort played, as it is not often
played at the village. It is a very popular amusement at the
deer-hunting camps, where Lieut. Ray often saw it played. According to
him the players are divided into sides, who sit on the ground about 3
yards apart, each side sticking up one of the marline spikes for a mark
to throw the twisters at. Six of the latter, he believes, make a full
set. One side tosses the whole set one at a time at the opposite stake,
and the points which they make are counted up by their opponents from
the position of the twisters as they fall. He did not learn how the
points were reckoned, except that twisters with a mark on them counted
differently from the plain ones, or how long the game lasted, each side
taking its turn of casting at the opposite stake. He, however, got the
impression that the winning side kept the twisters belonging to their
opponents. Mr. Nelson informs me in a letter that a similar game is
played with the same implements at Norton Sound.</p>

<p>No. 56532 [9], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a bag full of these tools as used
for playing this game. It contains 18 twisters, of different patterns,
and 7 marline spikes. The bag is of membrane, perhaps a bladder. It is
ovoid in shape, all in one piece, with a long opening in one side, which
is closed by a piece of sinew braid about 40 inches long. This is
knotted by one end round a fold of membrane at one end of the mouth, and
when the bag is shut up is wrapped round the middle of it.</p>

<p>Some of these people have learned what cards are from the
Nunatañmiun, though they do not know how to use them. They described how
they were used by the “Nunatañmiun,” however, going through the motions
of dealing cards. They told us that the latter played a great deal, and
“gave much.” This “giving much” evidently referred to gambling, for they
told Capt. Herendeen how two of the “Nunatañmiun” would sit down to
play, one with a big pile of furs and one without any, and when they got
up the furs would all belong to the other man.</p>

<p>Fig. 364 (No. 56531 [21]) represents some of a bunch of 25 little
ivory images which were strung on a bit of seal thong. One is a neatly
carved fox, 2.7 inches long, and the rest are ducks or geese, rather
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page365" id = "page365">
365</a></span>
roughly carved, with flat bellies. The largest of these is 1.3 inches
long and the smallest 0.8 inch. These were purchased at Plover Bay,
eastern Siberia, during our brief visit in August, 1881, and were
supposed to be merely works of art. I&nbsp;was, however, very much
interested on my return to Washington to find that Dr. Franz Boas had
brought from Cumberland Gulf a number of precisely similar images, which
are there used for playing a game of the nature of “jackstones.” The
player tosses up a handful of these images, and scores points for the
number that sit upright when they fall.<a class = "tag" name = "tag484"
id = "tag484" href = "#note484">484</a> It is therefore quite likely
that they are used for a similar purpose at Plover Bay. If this be so,
it is a remarkable point of similarity between these widely separated
Eskimo, for I can learn nothing of a similar custom at any intermediate
point.</p>

href = "#games">Festivals.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>The most important festivals are apparently semireligious in
character and partake strongly of the nature of dramatic
representations. At these festivals they make use of many articles of
dress and adornment, not worn on other occasions, and even some
“properties” and mechanical contrivances to add to the dramatic effect.
All festivals are accompanied by singing, drumming, and dancing.</p>

<p>At the formal festivals, in the early winter, the performers are
dressed in new deerskin clothing, with the snow-white flesh side
outward, and in certain parts of the performance wear on their heads
tall conical caps covered with rows of mountain sheep teeth which rattle
as the wearer dances.</p>

<p>We brought home one of these dancing caps (kă´brû, käluka´)
(No.&nbsp;89820 [863] Fig. 365), made of deerskin with the hair inward
and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page366" id = "page366">
366</a></span>
clipped close. The outside is painted all over with red ocher. The front
is nearly all in one piece, but the back is irregularly pieced and
gored. It is surmounted by a thick tuft of brown and white wolverine fur
about 5 inches long, sewed into the apex. To the middle of one side at
the edge is sewed a narrow strip of deerskin with the hair clipped
close, which is long enough to go under the wearer’s chin and be knotted
into a slit close to the edge of the other side of the cap. On the front
edge is sewed a row of thirty-five incisor teeth of the mountain sheep
by a thread running through a hole drilled through the root of each.</p>

<p>The series is regularly graduated, having the largest teeth in the
middle and the smallest on the ends. Above this is a narrow strip of
brown deerskin running two-thirds round the cap and sewed on flesh side
out so that the hair projects as a fringe below. Above this are three
ornamental bands about 2 inches apart running two-thirds round the cap,
each fringed on the lower edge with sheep teeth strung as on the edge of
the cap. The lower row contains 54 teeth, the middle 29, and the upper
31. The lowest band is made of 2 strips of mountain sheepskin with a
narrow strip of black sealskin between them, and a narrow strip of brown
deerskin with the hair out; the next is of coarse gray deerskin with the
hair out; and the uppermost of brown deerskin with the flesh side <ins

<p>The custom of wearing this style of cap appears to be peculiar to the
northwestern Eskimo, as I find no mention for it elsewhere. It is
perhaps derived indirectly from the northern Indians, some of whom are
represented as wearing a similar headdress.</p>

<p>In certain parts of the same ceremony as witnessed by Lieut. Ray the
dancers also wore rattle mittens, which were shaken in time to the
music. A&nbsp;pair of these were offered for sale once, but Lieut. Ray
did not consider them sufficiently of pure Eskimo manufacture to be
worth the price asked for them. They were made of sealskin and covered
all over the back with empty Winchester cartridge shells loosely
attached by a string through a hole in the bottom, so as to strike
against each other when the mitten was shaken. The five men who wore
these mittens wore on their heads the stuffed skins of various animals,
the wolf, bear, fox, lynx, and dog, which they were supposed to
represent. These articles were never offered for sale, as they were
probably too highly valued.</p>

<p>We collected twelve wooden masks, which we were told were worn in
some of these ceremonies, though none of our party ever witnessed any

performance in which they were used. Some of them are of undoubted age.
No. 56499 [6] (Fig. 366) has been selected as the type of these <ins

(ki´nau, from ki´na, face). This is a rather good representation of a
male human face, 8.8 inches long and 5.8 wide. It is quite smoothly
carved out of cottonwood, and the back is neatly hollowed out, being
more deeply excavated round the eyes and mouth and inside of the nose.
The mouth is represented as wide open, showing the tip of the tongue
attached to the underlip, and has six small teeth which look like dog’s
incisors inserted in a row in the middle of the upper lip. The eyebrows
and moustache are marked out with blacklead, and there are traces of red
ocher on the cheeks. The holes for the strings are in the edge about on
a level with the eyes. One end of a string of seal thong long enough to
go around the wearer’s head is passed out through the hole on the right
side, slit close to the tip, and the other end passed through this. The
other end is passed out through the hole on the left and made fast with
two half hitches. A&nbsp;row of small holes round the edge of the mask
shows where a hood has been tacked on. This mask is rather old and
somewhat soiled.</p>

<p>A very old weathered mask (No. 56497 [235] from Utkiavwĭñ), 7.8
inches long, and made of soft wood, apparently pine, is similar to the
preceding, but has no tongue, and the teeth in both jaws are represented
as a continuous ridge. It has an “imperial” as well as a moustache,
marked with blacklead like the eyebrows. The cheeks are colored with red
ocher. The edge is much gapped and broken, but shows the remains of a
deep narrow groove running round on the outside about ¼ inch from the
edge, and pierced with small holes for fastening on a hood.</p>

<p>Figure 367 (No. 89817 [856] also from Utkiavwĭñ) is a mask much like
the preceding, 7.5 inches long, and made of spruce. It is peculiar
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page368" id = "page368">

in having the outer corners of the eyes rather depressed, and in
addition to the moustache and imperial has a broad “whaleman’s mark”
drawn with black lead across the eyes. It is grooved round the edge for
fastening on a hood. The lower part of the face has been split off at
the corners of the mouth and mended on with two stitches of whalebone,
and a piece which was broken out at the left-hand corner of the mouth is
secured by a wooden peg at the inner edge and a stitch of whalebone on
the lower side. This mask has been for a long time fastened to an
ornamented wooden gorget, and appeared to have been exposed to the
weather, perhaps at the cemetery. The string is made of unusually stout
sinew braid.</p>

<p>The remaining four ancient human masks are all masculine, and only
one has any indication of labrets. On this mask, No. 89812 [1063], there
are two small holes in the position of the labrets. It is probable that
the wearers of these masks are supposed to represent the ancient Eskimo,
who wore no labrets. A&nbsp;mask which was carelessly made for sale
(No.&nbsp;89814 [1056] from Utkiavwĭñ), however, has large plug-labrets
carved out. Though roughly carved this mask is a very characteristic
Eskimo face, and would almost pass as the portrait of a man of our
acquaintance in Utkiavwĭñ. The two little roughly carved human faces on
the top of this mask are probably merely for ornament. No such things
are to be seen on any of the old masks which have been actually used.
This mask seems to have been whittled out of the bottom of an old meat
tray, and has a string of whalebone. Most of the genuine masks are of
excellent workmanship, but two are quite roughly carved. One of these
especially is such a bungling piece of work that it would be set down as
commercial were it not weathered and evidently old. The painting never
goes farther than marking out the beard and eyebrows with soot or black
lead, and sometimes reddening the cheeks with ocher. Fig. 368
(No.&nbsp;89816 [1583] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a very old mask of cottonwood,
blackened with age and so rudely carved that the work was probably done
with a stone tool. It is grooved around the edge for fastening on a hood
and is 6.8 inches long.</p>

<p>The only female human masks seen are new and made for sale. One of
these (No.&nbsp;89819 [1057], Fig. 369, from Utkiavwĭñ) is roughly
whittled from the bottom of an old meat tray, and has the hair,
eyebrows, and a single line of tattooing on the chin painted with soot.
It is 8.7 inches long and has strings of whalebone.</p>

<p>Another (No. 56498 [73] from Utkiavwĭñ) is about the size of the
common masks and tolerably well made. It has the hair and eyebrows
marked with black lead. The last is a foot long, and like the one
figured
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page369" id = "page369">
369</a></span>
is roughly whittled out of the bottom of an old meat tray. It has the
hair, eyebrows, and a single stripe of tattooing on the chin marked with
black lead. This came from Utkiavwĭñ (No.&nbsp;89811 [1037]).</p>

<p>Another “commercial” mask (No. <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has superfluous close-parenthesis">89813</ins> [1074] from
Utkiavwĭñ) is very elaborate, but roughly and carelessly made. It is
almost flat, with the features hardly raised in relief. In each corner
of the mouth is inserted a slender ivory tusk about 1 inch long, and
besides the eyebrows, moustache, and imperial, there is a broad
“whaleman’s mark” running obliquely across the right cheek from the
bridge of the nose. Six long feathers are stuck in the edge of the
forehead. Curiously enough these are the feathers of the South American
ostrich, and came from the feather duster in use at our station.</p>

<p>Fig. 370 (No. 56496 [258] from Utkiavwĭñ) represents, rather rudely,
a&nbsp;wolf’s face and ears, and is the only animal mask we obtained or
saw. It is of cottonwood, old and weathered, and is 4.7 inches long and
6.5 wide. It is painted on the edge with red ocher and has a streak of
the same color down the ridge of the nose. The string is of whalebone
and unbraided sinew pieced together.</p>

<p>Fig. 371 (No. 89815 [1050] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a mask that seems
almost too small to have been worn, being only 6.1 inches long and 4.7
wide. It is very old, made of blackened cottonwood, and is the rudest
representation of the human face which we saw. It is simply an oval
disk, concavo-convex, with holes cut for the eyes, nostrils, and mouth.
The rough cutting about the chin appears to have been done with a stone
tool, and the mouth seems to be smeared with blood. The string passed
through the holes in the forehead to hang it up by is much newer than
the mask, being braided from cotton twine and fastened to a common
galvanized boat nail.</p>

<p>The more southern Eskimo of Alaska are in the habit of using in their
dances very elaborate and highly ornamented and painted masks, of which
the National Museum possesses a very large collection. The ancient
Aleuts also used masks.<a class = "tag" name = "tag485" id = "tag485"
href = "#note485">485</a> On the other hand, no other Eskimo, save those
of Alaska, ever use masks in their performances, as far as I can learn,
with the solitary exception of the people of Baffin Land, where a mask
of the hide of the bearded seal is worn on certain occasions.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag486" id = "tag486" href = "#note486">486</a>
Nordenskiöld saw one wooden mask among the people near the <i>Vega’s</i>
winter quarters, but learned that this had been brought from Bering
Strait, and probably from America.<a class = "tag" name = "tag487" id =
"tag487" href = "#note487">487</a></p>

<p>The masks appear to become more numerous and more elaborate the
nearer we get to the part of Alaska inhabited by the Indians of the
T’linket stock, who, as is well known employ, in their ceremonies
remarkably elaborate wooden masks and headdresses. It may be suggested
that this custom of using masks came from the influence of these
Indians, reaching in the simple form already described as far as Point
Barrow, but not beyond.<a class = "tag" name = "tag488" id = "tag488"
href = "#note488">488</a> With these masks was worn a gorget or
breast-plate, consisting of a half-moon shaped piece of board about 18
inches long, painted with rude figures of men and animals, and slung
about the neck. We brought home three of these gorgets, all old and
weathered.</p>

<p>No. 89818 [1132], Fig. 372<i>a</i>, has been selected as the type of
the gorget (sûkĭmûñ). It is made of spruce, is 18.5 inches long, and has
two beckets of stout sinew braid, one to go round the neck and the other
round the body under the wearer’s arms. The figures are all painted on
the front face. In the middle is a man painted with red ocher; all the
rest of the figures are black and probably painted with soot. The man
with his arms outstretched stands on a large whale, represented as
spouting. He holds a small whale in each hand. At his right is a small
cross-shaped object which perhaps represents a bird, then a man facing
toward the left and darting a harpoon with both hands, and a bear facing
to the left. On the left of the red man are two umiaks with five men in
each, a&nbsp;whale nearly effaced, and three of the cross-shaped objects
already mentioned. Below them, also, freshly drawn with a hard, blunt
lead pencil or the point of a bullet, are a whale, an umiak, and a
three-cornered object the nature of which I can not make out.</p>

<p>Fig. 372<i>b</i> (No. 56493 [266] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a similar
gorget, which has evidently been long exposed to the weather, perhaps at
the cemetery, as the figures are all effaced except in the middle, where
it was probably covered by a mask as in Fig. 367 (No.&nbsp;89817 [855]
from the same village). There seems to have been a red border on the
serrated edge. In the middle is the same red man as before standing on
the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page371" id = "page371">
371</a></span>
black whale and holding a whale in each hand. At his right is a black
umiak with five men in it, and at his left a partially effaced figure
which is perhaps another boat. The strings are put on as before, except
that the two beckets are separate. The upper is made of sinew braid, and
the lower, which is now broken, of seal thong. This gorget is 15.5
inches long and 4.7 wide. No. 89817 [855] (Fig. 367 already
referred&nbsp;to) has a mask tied over the middle by means of the
beckets, so that the figures in the middle are much fresher than those
on the ends. The edges are painted red. In the middle is the same red
man or giant holding the whale. The other figures are painted with
soot.</p>

<p>This man or giant, able to hold out a whale, appears to be a
legendary character, as we have his image carved in ivory. We
unfortunately did not succeed in learning anything more about him,
except that his name (apparently) was “kikámigo.” Hanging by the head to
each elbow of this figure is a seal, and opposite its thighs two of the
usual conventional
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page372" id = "page372">
372</a></span>
whale’s tails, one on each side, with the flukes turned from him. The
one on his left is attached to his waist by a straight line from its
upper corner. At its right hand are a number of objects irregularly
grouped. At the top an umiak with five men towing at a three-cornered
object, which probably represents a dead whale; then a smaller umiak
containing five men and apparently “fast” to a whale, which is spouting.
A&nbsp;figure above this, almost obliterated, appears to be a small
whale. Below are a large seal, three of the cross-shaped figures, four
small whales, and one figure so much effaced that it can not be made
out. On the left hand of the figure are two umiaks, and a whale with a
line and float attached to him, then four crosses and a large seal in
the corner. Below are four whales of different sizes, two bears, and a
dog or wolf.</p>

<p>These gorgets appear to have gone out of fashion, as we saw none
which were not very old, or which appeared to have been used recently.
From the nature of the figures upon them, they were probably used in
some of the ceremonies connected with the whale fishing. Kika´mĭgo may
be the “divinity” who controls the whales and other sea animals.<a class

<p>In one of the performances which Capt. Herendeen witnessed, there
stood in the middle of the floor facing each other, the stuffed skins of
a fox and a raven. These were mounted on whalebone springs and moved by
strings, so that the fox sprang at the raven and the raven pecked at the
fox, while the singing and dancing went on. These animals were never
offered for sale, but they brought over a stuffed fox very cleverly
mounted so as to spring at a lemming, which by means of strings was made
to run in and out of two holes in the board on which the fox was
mounted. (No. 89893 [1378] from Utkiavwĭñ.) We unfortunately did not
learn the story or myth connected with this representation.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag490" id = "tag490" href = "#note490">490</a> It was the
skin of an Arctic fox in the summer pelage, with the paws and all the
bones removed, and clumsily stuffed with rope yarn, not filling out the
legs. A&nbsp;stick was thrust into the tail to within about two inches
of the tip, so that it was curled up over the back. The skin was taken
off whole by a single opening near the vent, which was left open, and
through which was thrust into the body a strip of whalebone 2 inches
wide and about ⅛ inch thick, which protruded about 4¼ inches and was
fastened to the front edge of the hole by tying the flap of skin to the
whalebone with three or four turns of sinew braid, kept from slipping by
a notch in each edge of the whalebone.</p>

<p>The fox was attached to a piece of the paneling of a ship’s bulkhead,
29 inches long and 7.5 wide, by bending forward 2¾ inches of the end of
the whalebone, and lashing it down parallel to the length of the board
with four turns of stout thong, kept from slipping by a notch in each
edge of the whalebone and running through holes in the board.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page373" id = "page373">
373</a></span>
The fox was thus held up by the spring parallel to the length of the
board with its head and forelegs raised. A&nbsp;string of sinew braid 10
feet long was passed through a hole in the septum of the fox’s nose and
knotted once so as to leave two equal ends. These ends were carried down
through two holes, one in each edge of the board 9½ inches from the
forward end, and each was tied to a roughly-rounded bit of pine stick
round which it was reeled when not in use. By pulling these strings
together, the fox was made to dart down his head, which was raised by
the spring as soon as the string was slackened. By pulling one or the
other string the fox could be made to dart to one or the other side of
the board.</p>

<p>One man manipulated the fox, pulling a string with each hand. The
lemming’s holes were about 1¼ inches in diameter, one in each edge of
the board and at such a distance from the end that when the string,
which was 7 feet 4 inches long, was drawn through them, it crossed the
board just where the fox’s nose struck, when it was pulled down. The
ends of the string were reeled round bits of stick. The lemming was a
narrow strip of wolf’s fur, about 3 inches long, doubled in the middle,
with the middle of the string hitched into the bight. By pulling the
ends of the string alternately, the lemming was made to jump out of the
hole on one side, run across the board and into the other, very much as
a live lemming runs from one tunnel to another on the tundra. It took
two persons, one on each side, to handle the lemming. The foxskin and
spring appeared to be older than the rest of the machine. The board was
originally 10 inches or 1 foot longer at each end, but had to be cut off
to pack it.</p>

<p>Petroff mentions a similar custom among the “Nushegagmute” of Bristol
Bay, of introducing stuffed animals moved with hidden strings in their
performances;<a class = "tag" name = "tag491" id = "tag491" href =

<p>It is greatly to be regretted that we had not established such
intimate relations with the natives, as afterwards was the case, in the
winter of 1881-’82, since this was the only one of the two seasons that
the great winter festival was held at Utkiavwĭñ. In the winter of
1882-’83 there had been so many deaths in the village that the natives
did not feel like celebrating any regular festival, and only indulged in
a few impromptu dances late in the season. These were unfortunately held
in the evening when the writer’s tour of duty at the station prevented
his witnessing them. Those of the party who did go over brought back
only fragmentary and rather vague accounts of the performance. The
confining nature of the work at the station prevented our witnessing any
of the celebrations at Nuwŭk or at Pernyû, when the “Nunatañmiun”
visitors were entertained.</p>

<p>The best accounts we have of any performance is given by Lieut.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page374" id = "page374">
374</a></span>
Ray. He and Capt. Herendeen went over to Utkiavwĭñ by special invitation
on December 3, 1881, and witnessed one scene of the “wood,” or “tree
dance.” Many visitors were present from Nuwŭk on the occasion of this
dance, which lasted for two days and nights. On arriving at the village
they found a crowd of upwards of 200 people assembled round the entrance
of the kû´dyĭgĭ. In front of the entrance were drawn up in line five men
and two women dancing to the music of a drum and two singers.</p>

<p>They were all dressed in new deerskin clothes, with the snow-white
flesh side turned out, and wore conical dance caps like that already
described. They kept time to the music with their feet, moving their
bodies to right and left with spasmodic jerks. To quote from Lieut.
Ray’s MS. notes:</p>

<blockquote>
Each dancer in turn sprang to the front and in extravagant gestures went
through the motions of killing seal, walrus, and deer, and the pursuit
of the whale. Each, as he finished, took his place in the line, was
cheered by the crowd, then added his voice to the monotonous chant of
the singers.</blockquote>

<p>After all had finished as many as could get in entered the “dance
house.” At one end of this a small space was partitioned off with a
piece of an old sail, and from the roof in the middle hung an object
intended to represent a tree. This was made of two oblong boxes about 6
inches in diameter, open at both ends, the lower about 2½ feet long and
the upper about 1½, hinged together with seal thong. At one side hung a
wolf’s skull, and on the other a dried raven. Two performers sat in the
middle of the floor with their legs extended one between the other’s
legs, with his nose touching the tree. A&nbsp;row of old men beat drums
and sang, while the performers chanted a monotonous song, in which could
be heard the words “rum, tobacco, seal, deer, and whale.”</p>

<p>Presently the bottom of the curtain was lifted and out crawled five
men on all fours, wearing on their heads the stuffed skins of the heads
of different animals&mdash;the wolf, bear, fox, lynx, and dog. They
swung their heads from side to side in unison, keeping time to the
music, uttering a low growl at each swing and shaking their rattle
mittens. This they kept up for fifteen or twenty minutes, while the
chant still went on, and the chief performer, with excited gestures,
embraced the tree and rubbed his nose against it from time to time. At
last all “sprang to their feet with a howl, and ended the dance with
wild gestures.” Similar scenes, with new performers, which our party did
not stay to witness, succeeded this, with feasting in the different
houses.</p>

<p>Capt. Herendeen also witnessed a small dance, lasting only one
evening, which bore a curious resemblance to some of the so-called
“favor figures” performed in the “German cotillon” of civilized dancers.
This kind of dance was performed purely for pleasure, and had nothing
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page375" id = "page375">
375</a></span>
religious or dramatic about it. The music was furnished by the usual
orchestra of old men, who beat drums and sang a monotonous song. Each
person who intended to take part in the dance came provided with some
small article to be given away as a “favor,” and rising in his turn,
danced a few minutes, and then called out the name of the partner he
wished to give it to. The latter then rose, and having received the
“favor,” danced a while with him, and then both resumed their places
among the spectators.</p>

<p>We never heard of any such elaborate “donation parties” as are
described at Norton Sound and the Yukon region, where a man “saves up
his property for years” to distribute it among his guests.<a class =

<p>Dances in which the children only take part, entirely for amusement,
sometimes take place in the kû´dyĭgĭ, and people occasionally amuse
themselves by dancing in the iglu. I&nbsp;have often seen the natives,
especially the children and young people, dancing in the open air, and
the dancing was always of very much the same character. The feet were
but slightly moved, keeping time to the music, while the body swayed
gracefully and the arms were waved from side to side. All the dancing
which I saw was rather quiet and graceful, but they told us that when
they got warmed up at a great dance they went at it with tremendous
vigor, throwing off their garments to the waist. The dance which
accompanies the song sung by the children to the aurora, however, is
more violent. The dancer clenches his fists and, bending his elbows,
strikes them against the sides of his body, keeping time to the song and
stamping vigorously with the right foot, springing up and down with the
left knee (see Fig. 373, from a sketch by the writer).</p>

<p>Though the children amuse themselves with a great many sports and
plays, we saw very few toys or playthings in use. We brought home six
objects which appear to have no use except as playthings.</p>

<p>Fig. 374<i>a</i> (No. 89806 [1189] from Nuwŭk) is a whirligig in
principle very like that made for civilized children. It is a block of
spruce, fitted with a shaft of narwhal ivory. This fits loosely in the
straight tubular handle, which is a section of the branch of an antler,
with the soft inside tissue cut out. A&nbsp;string of seal thong passes
through a hole in the middle of the handle and is fastened to the shaft.
This string is about 8 feet long, and about half of it is tied up into
the hank to make a handle for pulling it. It works very much like a
civilized child’s whirligig. The string is wound around the shaft and a
smart pull on the handle unwinds it, making the block spin round
rapidly. The reaction, spinning it in the opposite direction, winds up
the string again. A&nbsp;couple of loose hawk’s feathers are stuck into
the tip of the block, which is painted with red ocher for about an inch.
Four equidistant stripes of the same color run down the sides to a
border of the same width round the base. This was made for sale and
appears to be an unusual toy. I&nbsp;do not recollect ever seeing the
children play with such a toy. It is called kai´psa (Gr.&nbsp;kâvsâk,
“a&nbsp;whirligig or similar toy”).</p>

<p>Fig. 374<i>b</i> is a similar whirligig from Utkiavwĭñ (No. 89807
[1356]). The block, which is 4.2 inches long, is made of the solid tip
of a mountain sheep’s horn, and is elaborately ornamented with a
conventional pattern of lines and “circles and dots,” incised and
colored red with ocher. The shaft is of hard bone, and the line has a
little wooden handle at the end. The block is so heavy that it will
hardly spin.</p>

<p>Fig. 375 (No. 56491 [46] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a teetotum (also called
kaipsa). The shaft is of pine and the disk of spruce and is ornamented
with black lead marks, forming a border about one-quarter inch broad
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page377" id = "page377">
377</a></span>
on each face. The upper face is divided into quadrants by four narrow
lines radiating from the hole, and each quadrant is divided into two by
bands one-quarter inch broad. The order of these lines is reversed on
the under face. This is spun, like a common teetotum, with the fingers,
and does not seem to be common. I&nbsp;do not recollect ever seeing
anyone except the maker of this toy spinning one.</p>

<p>The same is true of No. 89722 [1087] (Fig. 376, from Utkiavwĭñ) which
is what American boys would call a “buzz” toy. It is of pine wood, and
through two round holes in the middle are passed the ends of a piece of
stout sinew braid, which are knotted together. When the board is placed
in the middle of the string it can be made to spin round and whiz by
alternately pulling and relaxing the ends of the string. The board is
rather elaborately painted. One end has a border of black lead on both
faces, the other a similar border of red paint, which appears to be red
lead. Broad red bands form a square 1 inch across around the holes, with
lines radiating from each corner to the corners of the board, on both
faces. On the spaces between these lines are figures rudely drawn with
black lead. On one face, in the first space, is a goose; in the second,
a&nbsp;man with a staff; in the third, the conventional figure of a
whale’s tail; and in the fourth, a&nbsp;whale with line and float
attached to him, pursued by a whaling umiak. On the other side, the
first space contains a dog or wolf walking; the second, two of these
animals, sitting on their haunches, facing each other; the third,
another walking; and the fourth, a&nbsp;reindeer in the same
attitude.</p>

<p>Fig. 377 (No. 89800 [1331] from Utkiavwĭñ), on the other hand, is a
toy which the children often play with. It is the well known
“whizzing-stick” found among savages in so many widely distant parts of
the world, and often used in religious ceremonies. The Eskimo name is
ĭmĭglúta. It consists of a thin board of pine wood, fastened by a string
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page379" id = "page379">
379</a></span>
of sinew braid about 1 foot long to the end of a slender rod, which
serves as a handle. When swung rapidly round by the handle it makes a
loud, whizzing sound. It is very neatly made, and painted with black
lead and red ocher. The tips of the board are black for about one-half
inch and the rest is red, and the upper half of the handle marked with
five rings about one-half inch wide and 1 inch apart, alternately black
and red. This appears to be purely a child’s toy and has no mystical
signification. I&nbsp;never saw one in the hands of an adult. This
specimen was made and brought over for sale by a lad about thirteen or
fourteen years old.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 378 (No. 56687 [181] from Utkiavwĭñ) is another plaything rather
common with the boys, which takes the place of the American boy’s “bean
snapper.” It is known by the name of mĭtĭ´glĭgaun, and is a rod of
whalebone, stiff and black, 4.8 inches long and 0.5 wide, narrowed and
bent sharply up for about an inch at one end. On the upper side of this
end, close to the tip, is a little hollow, large enough to hold a small
pebble, and the other is cut into sharp teeth. This is purely an
instrument of mischief and is used for shooting tiny pebbles at people
when they are looking the other way. Mûñialu showed us, with great glee,
in an expressive pantomime, how a boy would hit a person in the eye with
a little pebble, and, when the man turned round angrily, would have the
snapper slipped up his sleeve and be looking earnestly in another
direction. The toothed end, he said, was for mischievously scratching
hairs out of a man’s coat when he was looking another way. The “snapper”
is used as follows: It is held in the left hand, a&nbsp;little pebble is
set in the socket, and the tip of the whalebone bent back with the right
hand. When this end is let go the elasticity of the whalebone drives the
pebble at the mark with considerable force. As far as I can learn this
mischievous toy is peculiar to the Northwest.</p>

<p>Though several dolls and various suits of miniature clothing were
made and brought over for sale, they do not appear to be popular with
the little girls. I&nbsp;do not recollect ever seeing a child playing
with a doll. Those in the collection, indeed, seem rather less intended
for playthings than as, so to speak, works of art to catch the fancy of
the strangers. Such an object is No. 89728 [1304] (Fig. 379 from
Utkiavwĭñ.) This is a human head carved out of pine wood, and shouldered
off at the neck into a stout round peg, which is fitted into the middle
of a thick elliptical pedestal of the same wood, flat on the bottom and
convex on top. The head is dressed in a neatly made hood of thin
deerskin with the flesh side cut off round the shoulders and exposing
only the face. The face is very neatly carved, and has bits of green
oxidized copper inlaid for the eyes. The cheeks, gums, and inside of the
mouth are colored with red ocher, and the hair, eyebrows, and beard with
black lead. The top of the pedestal is painted red and divided into
eight equal parts by shallow grooves colored with black lead. The height
of the whole object is 4½ inches, and the workmanship is remarkably
good.</p>

head.</p>

<p>No. 89827 [1138] (from Utkiavwĭñ), on the other hand, is very roughly
and carelessly made. It is 18.2 inches long, roughly whittled out of a
flat piece of redwood board into the shape of a man with his legs wide
apart and holding up his hands on each side of his head. The arms are
very short and broad, with five fingers all nearly of the same length,
and the legs are simply two straight four-sided pegs rounded on the
edges. It is dressed in a hooded frock of seal gut reaching to the knees
and leaving only the face and hands uncovered, and has sealskin knee
boots on the legs. The face is rudely in relief, with two narrow bits of
ivory inlaid for eyes, and a long canine tusk of the same material
inserted in each corner of the mouth. Three small round bits of wood are
inlaid in the forehead, one in the middle and one over each eye, and one
in the right cheek above the corner of the mouth. The gut frock is
carelessly made of irregular pieces. It is trimmed round the bottom and
the edge of the hood with a strip of dogskin, but is left with a raw
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page381" id = "page381">
381</a></span>
edge round the wrists. The boots are rather well made models of the
regular waterproof boots, with soles of white sealskin and a band round
the top 1 inch wide of the same material. A&nbsp;short peg projects from
the top of the forehead. A&nbsp;string of stout sinew braid about 2 feet
long is passed through a hole in the middle of the body and a knot tied
in the end in front. Though the design is elaborate the workmanship is
very rude, and the clothes seem to be made of odds and ends. The maker
perhaps had in mind a fabulous man with teeth like a walrus, about whom
we heard some fragmentary traditions.</p>

player.</p>

<p>Fig. 380 (No. 89826 [1358] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a clever, though
somewhat roughly made, mechanical doll. It represents a man dressed in
deerskins sitting with his legs outstretched and holding in his extended
left hand a drum and in his right a stick, as if beating the drum. The
arms are of whalebone, and by pressing them he can be made to beat the
drum. The doll is made of a single piece of wood&mdash;a knot with two
branches, which make the legs. (I&nbsp;learned this from Capt.
Herendeen, who saw this doll at the village before it was finished.) The
height of the sitting figure is 11½ inches.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 381.&mdash;Mechanical toy: kaiak
paddler.</p>

<p>A still more ingenious mechanical toy which, however, like the
preceding, was made for sale, is shown in Fig. 381 (No.&nbsp;89855
[1351] from Utkiavwĭñ). This is a man sitting in a kaiak in the attitude
of paddling
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page382" id = "page382">
382</a></span>
on the left side with a single-bladed paddle. His arms are of whalebone,
and by means of strings he can be made to paddle and turn his head from
side to side. The kaiak is 29 inches long, very neatly carved from a
single block of wood, and solid except at the cockpit. The bottom is
flat, to allow it to stand on the floor, but it is otherwise precisely
of the model of the kaiaks in the Museum from the Mackenzie and Anderson
region. The nation who made it called it a “Kûñmû´d’lĭñ” kaiak. It is
painted all over with red ocher, except on the bottom. The figure has no
legs and fits into the cockpit, which is without any coaming. The head
is separate and mounted on a long, slender pivot, which is fitted into a
hole in the neck just loosely enough to allow it to turn easily. It is
dressed in a hood of seal gut. The face is very natural, though rather
rudely carved, and is lightly colored all over with red ocher, with the
mouth painted deeply red, and the eyebrows, eyes, nostrils, and beard
marked with black lead. The arms are narrow strips of whalebone, the
ends of which protrude at the wrists, and are tied to the paddle by the
ends of the strings which work it. The body is covered with a gut
shirt.</p>

block of wood.</p>

<p>The paddle is of the common shape, and has the blade and the lower
end of the shaft painted red. The strings for working this contrivance
are of fine sinew braid. One string is tied into a little hole in the
edge of the hood, where the left ear would be, the other passes round
the edge of the hood, and is tied at the right ear. These strings cross
back of the head, and pass through two neat little ivory eyebolts
inserted in the deck, 1&nbsp;inch abaft the cockpit, and 1 inch apart.
The strings from the hands are not crossed, but pass through two similar
eyebolts, one at each edge of the deck, 2.5 inches from the cockpit. The
ends of each set of strings are tied together. When the right pair and
left pair of strings are pulled alternately, the man makes a stroke and
looks to the right, then “recovers” and looks to the left. Both stroke
and “recovery” are aided by the elasticity of the arms. This specimen
shows a great deal of mechanical ingenuity, and was the only finished
object of the kind seen.</p>

<p>Fig. 382 (No. 89856 [783] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a kaiak intended for a
similar toy, which, when brought over for sale, had an unfinished
armless doll in the cockpit. This was, unfortunately, lost in unpacking.
The kaiak, which is 27.6 inches long, is not new, but has been freshly
scraped and painted on deck. It is also a foreign kaiak, being precisely
like a model brought by Mr. Nelson from Norton Sound. It is not unlikely
that this boat itself came from that region through the “Nunatañmiun,”
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page383" id = "page383">
383</a></span>
unless, possibly, a&nbsp;southern kaiak had passed through the hands of
enough people to reach a point where some Point Barrow native might see
it. As far as we know no Point Barrow natives visit the regions where
this form is used, and the model seems too accurate to have been made
from a description.</p>

<p>We sometimes saw the children playing with little models of the
implements and utensils used by their parents. Perhaps the commonest
thing of this sort is the boy’s bow. As soon as a boy is able to walk
his father makes him a little bow suited to his strength, with blunt
arrows, with which he plays with the other boys, shooting at
marks&mdash;for instance, the fetal reindeer brought home from the
spring hunt&mdash;till he is old enough to shoot small birds and
lemmings. We also saw children playing with little drums, and one man
made his little boy an elaborate kă´moti about 4 feet long. In the
collection are a number of miniature implements, spears, etc., some of
which have been already described, which were perhaps intended as
playthings for the children. As, however, they were all newly made, it
is possible that they were merely intended to catch the fancy of the
strangers.</p>

<p>No. 89451 [1113], from Nuwŭk, is a little snow shovel 4.5 inches
long, with a blade 2.1 inches wide, rather roughly carved from a piece
of walrus ivory.</p>

<p>No. 89695 [1280] from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar model of a deer lance,
7&nbsp;inches long, all in one piece and made of reindeer antler.</p>

<p>No. 89797 [1186] from Utkiavwĭñ, is a quite well made model of the
drum used for accompanying singing and dancing, and is almost large
enough to have been used for a plaything. The stick is entirely out of
proportion, being merely a roughly whittled bit of lath, 13 inches
long.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "toys_sports" id = "toys_sports" href =
"#toys">Games and sports.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>The men have very few sports, though I have sometimes known them to
amuse themselves by shooting at a mark with their rifles, and I once
heard of a number of them wrestling. As far as I could learn, they
wrestle “catch-as-catch-can” without any particular system. We never
heard of anything like the athletic sports mentioned by Egede<a class =
"tag" name = "tag499" id = "tag499" href = "#note499">499</a> and
Crantz<a class = "tag" name = "tag500" id = "tag500" href =
"#note500">500</a> or the pugilism described by Schwatka among the
people of King William’s Land, when two men stand up to each other and
exchange buffets till one or the other gives in.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag501" id = "tag501" href = "#note501">501</a> The women are very fond
of playing “cat’s cradle” whenever they have leisure, and make a number
of complicated figures with the string, many of which represent various
animals. One favorite figure is a very clever representation of a
reindeer, which is made by moving the fingers to run down hill from one
hand to the other.<a class = "tag" name = "tag502" id = "tag502" href =
"#note502">502</a> Another favorite amusement with the women and
children is tossing three bullets or small pebbles with the right hand,
after the manner of a juggler,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page384" id = "page384">
384</a></span>
keeping one ball constantly in the air. Some of the women are very
skillful at this, keeping the balls up for a long time. This play is
accompanied by a chant sung to a monotonous tune with very little air,
but strongly marked time. I&nbsp;never succeeded in catching the words
of this chant, which are uttered with considerable rapidity, and do not
appear to be ordinary words. It begins “yúɐ yúɐ yuká, yúɐ yúɐ yuká;” and
some of the words are certainly indelicate to judge from the unequivocal
gestures by which I once saw them accompanied.</p>

<p>In the winter the young women and girls are often to be seen tossing
a snowball with their feet. A&nbsp;girl wets some snow and makes a ball
about as big as her two fists, which of course immediately becomes a
lump of ice. This she balances on the toe of one foot and with a kick
and a jump tosses it over to the other foot which catches it and tosses
it back. Some women will keep this up for a number of strokes.</p>

<p>The young people of both sexes also sometimes play football, kicking
about an old mitten or boot stuffed with rags or bits of waste skin.
I&nbsp;never saw them set up goals and play a regular game as they did
in Greenland.<a class = "tag" name = "tag503" id = "tag503" href =
"#note503">503</a></p>

<p>The little girls also play with the skipping rope. I once watched
three little girls jumping. Two swung the rope and the other stood in
the middle and jumped. First they swung the rope under her feet to the
right, then back under her feet to the left, and then once or twice
wholly round under her feet and over her head, and then began again.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag504" id = "tag504" href = "#note504">504</a>
They also play at housekeeping, laying sticks round to represent the
sides of the house, or outlining the house by pressing up ridges of snow
between their feet. Sometimes they mark out a complicated labyrinth on
the snow in this way, and the game appears to be that one shall guard
this and try to catch the others if they come in, as in many of the
games of civilized children.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the formal children’s dances. They often
also dance by themselves, beating on old tin cans for drums. One night I
saw a party of children having quite an elaborate performance near our
station. The snow at the time was drifted up close under the eaves of
the house. On the edge of the roof sat three little boys, each beating
vigorously on an empty tomato can and singing at the top of his lungs,
while another boy and a little girl were dancing on the snow waving
their arms and singing as usual, and at the same time trying to avoid
another girl about thirteen years old, who represented a demon. She was
stooping forward, and moving slowly round in time with the music,
turning from side to side and rolling her eyes fiercely, while she
licked the blade of an open clasp knife, drawing it slowly across her
lips. They seemed intensely in earnest, and were enjoying themselves
hugely. After dancing a while at the station they went over to the
village, and as they told me the next day spent the whole night singing
in a vacant snow-house.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page385" id = "page385">
385</a></span>
<p>They also amuse themselves in the winter by sliding on their knees
down the steepest snowdrifts under the cliffs. A&nbsp;good deal of the
time, however, they are following their parents or other grown people,
catching little fish or fetching twigs for firewood or helping drive the
dogs, though as a rule they are not made to do any regular work until
they are pretty well grown.</p>

<p>The only musical instrument in use among these people is the
universal drum<a class = "tag" name = "tag505" id = "tag505" href =
"#note505">505</a> or tambourine (kĕlyau), consisting of a membrane
stretched over a hoop with a handle on one side, and used from Greenland
to Siberia. It is always accompanied by the voice singing or chanting.
The player holds the handle in his left hand with the membrane away from
him, and strikes alternately on each side of the rim with a short heavy
piece of ivory, or a long slender wand, rotating the drum slightly at
the same time to meet the stroke. This produces a loud, resonant, and
somewhat musical note. There appears, however, to be no system of tuning
these drums, the pitch of the note depending entirely on accident.</p>

<p>We collected four of these drums, of which every household possesses
at least one. They are all of essentially the same construction, but
vary in size. No. 56741 [79], Fig. 383, has been selected as the type.
The frame is a flat strip of willow 67 inches long, 1&nbsp;inch wide,
and 0.3 inch thick, bent till the two ends meet, thus making a hoop 22.2
inches long and 19 inches wide. The ends are fastened together by a
strap of walrus ivory on the inside of the hoop, secured to the wood by
neat stitches of black whalebone. The handle is of walrus ivory 5.2
inches long. The larger end is rather rudely carved into a human face.
Back of this head and 1 inch from the large end of the handle is a
square transverse notch, deep and sufficiently wide to fit over both rim
and strap at the joint. It is held on by a lashing of sinew braid
passing through holes in rim and strap, one on each side of the handle,
and a large transverse hole in the latter, below and a little in front
of the notch. The membrane, which appears to be a sheet of the
peritoneum of a seal, is stretched over the other side of the hoop,
which is beveled on the outside edge, and its edge is brought down to a
deep
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page386" id = "page386">
386</a></span>
groove 0.2 inch from the edge of the hoop and 0.3 inch wide, running
round the hoop, where it is secured by three or four turns of sinew
braid. The end of this string is crossed back and forth four or five
times round the handle, where it is fitted to the hoop and then wrapped
around it and finished off with a knot.</p>

<p>No. 56742 [514], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar drum, but somewhat
larger, the hoop being 24.6 inches long and 22 inches wide. It is of the
same materials, except that the strap at the joint is of reindeer
antler. Opposite the joint the hoop appears to have shown signs of
weakness, as it has been strengthened with two straps of walrus ivory,
one on the inside and one on the outside of the hoop, fastened together
by stitches of sinew which pass through the wood and through both
straps. The inside strap is 4.7 inches long, the outer 3.5 inches long,
and only half the width of the rim, and is let into the latter. This
strap appears to have been put on first, as at each end there is a
stitch which only runs through the wood. The handle is fastened on as
before, but has two transverse holes instead of one, and has four deep
rounded notches for the fingers. (See Fig. 384.) The joint is tightened
by driving a thin sliver of wood in at the bottom of the notch.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig.</span> 384.&mdash;Handle of drum secured
to rim.</p>

<p>No. 56743 [31], from Utkiavwĭñ, closely resembles the type, but has a
notch for the thumb as well as for the forefinger on the handle. The
hoop is 23.5 inches long and 21 wide. No. 56740 [80] from the same
village is rather smaller than the ordinary drums, having a hoop 16.2
inches long and 14.7 wide. The handle is of antler, but has the usual
face on the large end.</p>

<p>We also brought home eight handles for these drums, which exhibit but
slight variations. The commonest material for the handle is walrus
ivory. Only two out of the twelve are of antler. They are usually about
5 inches long (the longest is 5.4 inches and the shortest 4.6). Handles
with grooves for the fingers and sometimes for the thumb seem to be
quite as common as the plain handles. Fig. 385<i>a</i> represents an
ivory handle from Nuwŭk (No.&nbsp;89267 [898]), which has a groove for
each finger and a shallow one on the right side for the thumb. It is 5
inches long.</p>

<p>With one exception all these handles have the large end more or less
neatly carved into a human face, with the mouth open as if singing,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page387" id = "page387">
387</a></span>
probably from an idea similar to that which makes the decorative artists
of civilized countries ornament the pipes of a great organ with singing
faces. This face is usually in the position shown in the specimens
figured, but No. 89266 [784] (Fig. 385<i>b</i>), a handle of antler from
Utkiavwĭñ, has the axis of the face parallel to that of the handle. Nos.
89269 [975] and 56515 [76], both from Utkiavwĭñ, are peculiar in their
ornamentation. They are both of walrus ivory. The former has a
well-carved face at the large end with small blue beads inlaid for eyes.
In addition to this the small end has been rather freshly carved into a
rather rude seal’s head, and an ornamental pattern has been incised
round the middle. This specimen exhibits the grooves for the fingers
very well. The latter is a plain handle, but has a little sharp tusk
inserted at each corner of the mouth. The only handle without a human
face on the large end (No.&nbsp;56514 [65] Fig. 385<i>c</i>, from
Utkiavwĭñ) is peculiar in many respects. It is the butt end of a small
walrus tusk, with a large pulp cavity, the edges of which are much
notched and irregularly broken. The notch for fitting it to the handle
is at the smaller end, which is neatly carved into a very good figure of
a walrus head, with the tusks bent back to the under side of the handle.
The head has oval bits of wood inlaid for eyes. None of the drums or
handles in the collection are newly made.</p>

<p>The stick employed for beating these drums is commonly a slender
elastic wand about 2½ feet long, but they also sometimes use a short
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page388" id = "page388">
388</a></span>
thick stick of ivory resembling that used by the eastern Eskimo.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag506" id = "tag506" href = "#note506">506</a> We
brought home two of these sticks, both of which belong with the drum No.
56743 [31]. Fig. 386<i>a</i> (No.&nbsp;56540 [31]) is a roughly
cylindrical rod of ivory with a hole for a lanyard. The larger end is
ornamented by rudely incised and darkened lines which represent the eyes
and outline of the mouth of a “bow-head” whale. Fig. 386<i>b</i>
(No.&nbsp;56540 [31<i>a</i>]) is a plain round stick of ivory 9.4 inches
long. It is rather roughly made and somewhat warped. The use of the long
stick is perhaps derived from Siberia, where the short thick stick does
not appear to be used.<a class = "tag" name = "tag507" id = "tag507"

<p>Holes in the membrane of the drum are sometimes mended with pieces of
the crop of the ptarmigan. At any rate, this is what I was told by a
native, who begged from me the crops of two of these birds that I was
skinning, saying that he wanted them to mend his drum. These drums are
always beaten as an accompaniment to invocations of spirits or
incantations. This practice is so common that some authors are in the
habit of always speaking of them as “shaman drums”. As I have already
stated, their most common use is purely as a musical instrument, and
they are used not only by the so-called “shamans” but by everybody.</p>

<p>Their music consists of monotonous chants, usually with very little
perceptible air, and pitched generally in a minor key. I&nbsp;could not
perceive that they had any idea of “tune,” in the musical sense, but
when several sang together each pitched the tune to suit himself. They,
however, keep excellent time. The ordinary songs are in “common” or
time.<a class = "tag" name = "tag508" id = "tag508" href =
"#note508">508</a> The words are often extemporaneous, and at tolerably
regular intervals comes the refrain, “A&nbsp;yáña yáña, a&nbsp;yáña ya,”
which takes the place of the “ámna aja” of the eastern Eskimo.
Sometimes, when they are humming or singing to themselves, the words are
nothing but this refrain. Their voices, as a general thing, are
musical.</p>

<p>Like all Eskimo, they are very fond of music, and are constantly
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page389" id = "page389">
389</a></span>
singing and humming to themselves, sometimes, according to Capt.
Herendeen, waking up in the night to sing. Besides their regular
festivals they often amuse themselves in their houses by singing to the
drum. They are fond of civilized music, and, having usually very quick
and rather acute ears, readily catch the tunes, which they sing with
curiously mutilated words. We found “Shoo Fly” and “Little Brown Jug”
great favorites at the time of our arrival, and one old woman from
Nuwŭk, told us with great glee, how Magwa (Maguire) used to sing
“Tolderolderol.” Our two violins, the doctor’s and the cook’s, were a
constant source of delight to them.</p>

<p>Capt. Parry<a class = "tag" name = "tag509" id = "tag509" href =

of Fury and Hecla Straits.<a class = "tag" name = "tag510" id = "tag510"
href = "#note510">510</a></p>

<p>I regret extremely that I was not enough of a musician to write down
on the spot the different tunes sung by these people. The ordinary
monotonous chant is so devoid of air that I can not possibly recollect
it, and the same is true of the chant which accompanies the game of
pebble-tossing. I&nbsp;was able, however, to catch by ear the song sung
by the children when they dance to the aurora. I&nbsp;never had the
whole of this song, which we were told had a large number of stanzas.
The first three are as follows:</p>

<div class = "song">
<p class = "stanza">1. Kióya ke, kióya ke,</p>
<p>A, yáñɐ, yañɐ, ya,</p>
<p>Hwi, hwi, hwi, hwi!</p>

<p class = "stanza">2. Túdlĭmaná, túdlĭmaná,</p>
<p>A yáñɐ, yañɐ, ya,</p>
<p>Hwi, hwi, hwi, hwi!</p>

<p class = "stanza">3. Kálutaná, kalutaná,</p>
<p>A yáñɐ, yáñɐ, ya,</p>
<p>Hwi, hwi, hwi, hwi!</p>
</div>

<p>We did not succeed in learning the meaning of these words, except, of
course, that the first word, kióya, is aurora. When there is a bright
aurora, the children often keep on dancing and singing this song till
late into the night. A&nbsp;tune was introduced in the spring of 1883 by
a party of men from Kĭlauwĭtáwĭñ, who came up to take part in the
whale-fishing at Utkiavwĭñ. It became at once exceedingly popular, and
everybody was singing or humming it. It is peculiar in being in waltz or
time, and has considerably more air than the ordinary tunes.
I&nbsp;heard no words sung to it except: “O&nbsp;hai hai yáña,
O&nbsp;hai yáña, O&nbsp;haíja he, haíja he.” Mr. Dall informs me that he
recognizes this tune as one sung by the Indians on the Yukon.</p>


<h4><a name = "art" id = "art" href = "#top">ART.</a></h4>

<p>The artistic sense appears to be much more highly developed among the
western Eskimo than among those of the east. Among the latter,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page390" id = "page390">
390</a></span>
decoration appears to be applied almost solely to the clothing, while
tools and utensils are usually left plain, and if ornamented are only
adorned with carving or incised lines.<a class = "tag" name = "tag511"
id = "tag511" href = "#note511">511</a> West of the Mackenzie River, and
especially south of Bering Strait, Eskimo decorative art reaches its
highest development, as shown by the collections in the National Museum.
Not only is everything finished with the most extreme care, but all
wooden objects are gaily painted with various pigments, and all articles
of bone and ivory are covered with ornamental carvings and incised lines
forming conventional patterns.</p>

<p>There are in the collections also many objects that appear to have
been made simply for the pleasure of exercising the ingenuity in
representing natural or fanciful objects, and are thus purely works of
art. Want of space forbids any further discussion of these interesting
objects. There is in the Museum sufficient material for a large
monograph on Eskimo art. As would naturally be expected, art at Point
Barrow occupies a somewhat intermediate position between the highly
developed art of the southwest and the simple art of the east.
I&nbsp;have given sufficient figures in my description of their clothing
and various implements to illustrate the condition of purely decorative
art. A&nbsp;few words may be added by way of résumé. It will be noticed
that whenever the bone or ivory parts of weapons are decorated the
ornamentation is usually in the form of incised lines colored with red
ocher or soot. These lines rarely represent any natural objects, but
generally form rather elegant conventional patterns, most commonly
double or single borders, often joined by oblique cross lines or fringed
with short, pointed parallel lines.</p>

<p>A common ornament is the incised “circle and dot,” so often referred
to in the foregoing descriptions. This is a circle about one-quarter
inch in diameter, described as accurately as if done with compasses,
with a deeply incised dot exactly in the center. This ornament is much
more common south of Bering Strait, where, as Mr. L.&nbsp;M. Turner
informs me, it is a conventionalized representation of a flower. Some of
the older implements in our collection, ornamented with this figure, may
have been obtained by trade from the southern natives, but the Point
Barrow people certainly know how to make it, as there are a number of
newly made articles in the collection thus ornamented. Unfortunately, we
saw none of these objects in the process of manufacture, as they were
made by the natives during odd moments of leisure, and at the time I did
not realize the importance of finding out the process. No tool by which
these figures could be made so accurately was ever offered for sale.</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Turner nor Mr. Dall, both of whom, as is well known,
spent long periods among the natives of the Yukon region, ever observed
the process of making this ornament. The latter, however, suggests that
it is perhaps done with an improvised centerbit, made by sticking
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page391" id = "page391">
391</a></span>
two iron points close together in the end of a handle. While weapons are
decorated only with conventional patterns, other implements of bone or
ivory, especially those pertaining to the chase, like the seal drags,
etc., already mentioned, are frequently carved into the shape of
animals, as well as being ornamented with conventional patterns.
Carvings of animals’ heads usually have the mouth, nostrils, etc.,
indicated by blackened incisions, and often have small, colored beads,
bits of wood, or ivory inlaid for the eyes. When beads are used, the
perforation of the bead is generally made to represent the pupil of the
eye. Beads were also used for ornamenting dishes and other wooden
objects.</p>

<p>The harpoon blade boxes of wood carved into the shape of the animal
to be pursued have been already described. Other wooden objects, like
the shafts of lances, and arrows, paddles, boxes, dishes, the woodwork
of snowshoes, sledges, umiaks, etc., are frequently painted either all
over, or in stripes or bands. The pigment generally used is red ocher,
sometimes set off with stripes of black lead. The only case in which a
different pigment is used is that of some arrows from Sidaru, which, in
addition to the usual black or red rings, have a rather dingy green ring
round the shaft. This green looks as if it might have been derived from
the “green fungus or <i>peziza</i>,” mentioned by Dall as in use among
the ancient Aleuts.<a class = "tag" name = "tag512" id = "tag512" href =
"#note512">512</a> The red ocher is applied smoothly in a rather thin
coat which looks as if it were always put on in the manner observed by
Capt. Herendeen, who saw a man painting a new sled at Utkiavwĭñ. He
licked the freshly scraped wood with his tongue, so as to moisten it
with saliva and then rubbed it with a lump of red ocher. The custom of
painting wooden objects with red ocher seemed to be rather more common
among the “Nunatañmiun,” from whom perhaps the Point Barrow people
borrowed the fashion, which is not mentioned among the eastern Eskimo.
Nordenskiöld states that red is the favorite color among the natives of
Pitlekaj.<a class = "tag" name = "tag513" id = "tag513" href =
"#note513">513</a></p>

<p>The painting of the arrow shafts in many cases curiously resembles
the marks used by modern archers to distinguish the ownership of their
shafts, and may have formerly served the same purpose. We made no
inquiries about the matter on the spot, and there is no certain evidence
in the series of arrows collected that these are or are not marks of
ownership. Some arrows, apparently the property of the same man, have
different marks, while arrows from different villages are similarly
marked. On examining our series of fifty arrows from the three villages
(<ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads‘fourteeen’">fourteen</ins> from Nuwŭk, twenty from Utkiavwĭñ, and
sixteen from Sidaru) it will be seen that the commonest style of
painting is to have the shaft painted red from the beginning or middle
of the feathering to about one-fifth of its length from the head. Twenty
arrows are marked in this way&mdash;eleven from Nuwŭk, belonging to at
least two distinct sets, and nine from Utkiavwĭñ, belonging to three
sets. Nine have
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page392" id = "page392">
392</a></span>
about 8 inches of the middle of the shaft painted red, with a black ring
at the middle of the feathering. Seven of these are from Sidaru, one
from Nuwŭk, and one from Utkiavwĭñ. Five from Sidaru have a red ring
round the middle, and a green one about the middle of the feathering,
and four of the same set have also a red ring in front of the green one.
Three from Utkiavwĭñ, belonging to different sets, have the shaft
painted red from the middle to the beginning of the feathering, and
three red rings 2 inches from the nock. Seven belonging to these sets
from the two northern villages are unpainted.</p>

<p>A set of two small arrows which belong with the boy’s bow No. 89904
[786] are peculiar in their marking. About 5½ inches of the middle of
the shaft is painted red, there is a black ring round the middle, and a
black spiral running the whole length of the feathering.</p>

<p>The only decorative work in metal is to be seen in the pipes and
their accompanying picks and fire steel which have already been
described.</p>

<p>In addition to these illustrations of decorative art, we brought home
a series of seventy-nine objects which may be considered as purely works
of art without reference to decoration. Some of the older objects in
this series perhaps also served the purpose of amulets or charms,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag514" id = "tag514" href = "#note514">514</a>
but a number of the new ones were made simply as works of fancy for sale
to us. These objects are all carvings of various materials, sometimes
very rude and sometimes very neatly finished, but in most cases even
when rudely made highly characteristic of the object represented.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag515" id = "tag515" href = "#note515">515</a>
Walrus ivory, usually from the tusks, but sometimes from the teeth, is
the commonest material for these carvings. Thirty-six of the series are
made of this material, which is very well suited for the purpose, being
worked with tolerable ease, and capable of receiving a high finish.
Soapstone, from the ease with which it can be cut, is also rather a
favorite material. Seventeen of these carvings are made of soapstone, in
many cases evidently pieces of an old lamp or kettle. Other mineral
substances appear to be rarely used. Three images, all made for sale and
by the same hand, are of soft white gypsum and one tiny image of a bear
is rudely flaked out of gray flint. (There are in the collection a
number of rude images of whales, made by flaking from flint, jasper, and
glass, but as these were ascertained without doubt to be amulets, they
will be described under that head.) Eleven are made of wood, nine of
bone, one of antler, and one of the tooth of the polar bear.
Twenty-three of these carvings represent human beings, sometimes
intentionally grotesque and caricatured; twenty-one, bowhead whales;
fourteen, polar bears; five, seals; three, walruses; one, a&nbsp;beluga;
one, a&nbsp;fish; and seven, fanciful monsters. Four are ornamented
objects made for sale; not, strictly speaking, images.</p>

in Utkiavwĭñ by Lieut. Ray, and is very old, blackened, and dirty. The
carving was evidently done with a blunt instrument, probably a stone
tool. This specimen, which was perhaps the head of a doll, is 7.1 inches
in total length, with a head 3.4 inches long. We saw no similar object
of modern construction.</p>

<p>Figs. 388<i>a</i> and 388<i>b</i> (Nos. 89726 [1192] and 89727
[1193], from Utkiavwĭñ) are a pair of rather roughly whittled human
figures, a&nbsp;man and woman, respectively, both without clothes
(except that the woman has a black-lead mark round the calf of each leg
to indicate the tops of the boots). They were made for sale, and are
perhaps unfinished dolls. The man (No.&nbsp;89726 [1192]) is 11 inches
long and tolerably well proportioned, except about the feet, which are
very clumsily made. The eyes and mouth are incised and the hair colored
with black-lead. The woman (No.&nbsp;89727 [1193]) is a very similar
figure, but only 9.2 inches long. She has prominent breasts, and her
legs are shorter in proportion than the man’s.</p>

<p>No. 89725 [1185], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a clumsy image of a man, rudely
whittled out of a flat, hardwood stick, 7¼ inches long. The body and
legs are long, the latter somewhat straddling, with clumsy feet. The
outstretched arms are very short and stumpy. It has been painted all
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page394" id = "page394">

over with a thin coat of red ocher, and the legs and feet have a coat of
black lead over this. The hair also is marked out with black lead, and a
small opaque white bead is fastened with a peg to the middle of the
breast. This image was made for the market.</p>

<p>No. 56495<i>a</i> [203], from Utkiavwĭñ, is of a pair of very rude
images, also made solely for the market. Each is 8 inches long, and is
merely an oblong piece of board, flat and rough on the back, roughly
beveled from the middle to each side in front. One end is surmounted by
a rather rudely carved human head, with the features in relief and the
eyes and mouth incised. The eyebrows are marked out with black lead, and
there is a longitudinal line of black lead down the middle of the
front.</p>

<p>Fig. 389 (No. 89724 [1123] from Nuwŭk) is the face of a male Eskimo,
3.2 inches long, carved out of a flat piece of some coniferous wood
weathered to a dark, reddish brown. The labrets are represented by two
small, red glass beads with white centers, fastened on in the proper
position with wooden pegs. There is a deep groove around the edge of the
face into which is fastened a strip of yellowish wolfskin with long fur
to represent the trimming around the hood of the jacket. This specimen
was made for sale, and the carving is well executed. It is a
characteristic Eskimo face, and would pass for a portrait of Apaidyáo,
a&nbsp;well known young Eskimo, who was employed by Lieut. Ray as a
guide and hunter.</p>

<p>We collected only two soap-stone carvings representing men, both of
which were newly made. One of these, Fig. 390 (No.&nbsp;89569 [1095]
from Nuwŭk), is a grotesque image 2.9 inches long, roughly carved from a
flat piece of an old lamp or pot. This is almost exactly the form in
which the Eskimo, especially the children, usually draw a man. The
writer’s <i>portrait</i>
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page395" id = "page395">
395</a></span>
has been drawn in very much the same shape. The features are very rudely
indicated, and a long projecting tusk of bone is inserted at each corner
of the mouth and glued in with refuse oil. This figure is probably meant
to represent the “man with tusks,” before referred to, who figures in
several of the legendary fragments which we obtained.</p>

<p>No. 89568 [1108], from Utkiavwĭñ, probably represents the same being.
It is a mask of soapstone, a&nbsp;piece of an old lamp, 2.8 inches long,
with very characteristic features in low relief, and a pair of sharp,
projecting, decurved tusks, about 1 inch long, which appear to be made
of the vibrissæ of the walrus. The back of the mask is roughly hollowed
out. No. 89575 [1014], from Nuwŭk, is a clumsy and carelessly made image
of a man, 3.4 inches long, whittled out of a flat, rough piece of soft,
white gypsum. The arms are short and clumsy and the legs straddling, and
there is a large elliptical hole through the middle of the body. The
features are indicated only by digging little cavities for the eyes,
nostrils, and mouth. This and two other images of the same material,
a&nbsp;bear equally rude, and a very well carved and characteristic

mentioned.</p>

<p>The best bone figure of a man is shown in Fig. 391 (No. 89353 [1025],
from Nuwŭk), also newly made. This is an image, 5&nbsp;inches long, of
the giant “Kikámigo,” previously mentioned, and is a very excellent
piece of workmanship. The material is rather vascular compact bone. On
the head is a conical dancing cap, 1.4 inches high, made of deerskin,
with the flesh side out, and colored with red ocher, with a tuft of wolf
hairs, 3&nbsp;inches long, protruding from the apex. Around the middle
of the cap is a narrow strip of the same material fringed on the lower
edge with fifteen flat, narrow pendants of ivory, made to represent
mountain-sheep teeth. To the back of this strip is fastened a half-downy
feather nearly 4 inches long. A&nbsp;slender wooden stick is stuck into
the strip behind, so that the tip reaches just above the apex of the
cap. To a notch in the end of this is tied a bit of dressed deerskin, 1¼
inches long, cut into three strips.</p>

<p>Fig. 392 (No. 89348 [1127], from Utkiavwĭñ) is an image neatly carved
from whale’s bone, which may have been meant for an amulet, or possibly
the handle of a drill cord, as it is not new, and has two oblique holes
in the middle of the back, which meet so as to form a longitudinal
channel for a string. The eyes, mouth, and labret holes are incised and
filled with black dirt. The total length is 3.3 inches.</p>

<p>Fig. 393 (No. 89344 [1272], from Utkiavwĭñ) is a very grotesque image
of a naked man, rudely carved from compact, rather porous bone,
impregnated with oil, but scraped smooth. It is 5 inches long. The mouth
and eyes are incised and blackened, and the nostrils simply bored
out.</p>

<p>The ivory carvings representing human figures are all of rather rude
workmanship. No. 89352 [1100], Fig. 394, from Nuwŭk, is a tolerably good
figure, 3.3 inches long, of a sitting man <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘hold / ing’ without hyphen at line

and is made of walrus ivory yellow from age and oil. No. 89351 [1085]
from Nuwŭk, is a similar image, 3.8 inches long, newly made, with the
arms at the sides, roughly carved from coarse walrus ivory. The eyes and
mouth are incised and filled with dark colored dirt. Fig. 395
(No.&nbsp;89349 [980], from Nuwŭk) is an old image made of yellow walrus
ivory and closely resembling the bone image (No.&nbsp;89348 [1127])
already figured, but with the hands by the sides. It is 2.7 inches long
and has a string 4 inches long tied into the channel in the back.</p>

<p>Nos. 89346 and 89347 [990], from Nuwŭk, are a pair of little men,
standing erect, about 2 inches high, rather roughly carved, of slightly
yellow walrus ivory. Both have large, clumsy feet and legs, and the
eyes, nostrils, and mouth incised and filled in as usual with dark
colored dirt. The arms are in high relief. No. 89346 [990<i>b</i>] has
his hands clasped in front of him, while No. 89347 [990<i>a</i>] has
them clasped behind his back. The legs of the latter are excavated on
the inside as if to fit it upon the end of some object. It is more
probable, however, that this image was carved from the foreshaft of a
seal-dart, and that the excavation is merely the slot in the end of the
latter. These two images are evidently modern, but do not appear freshly
made. No. 89345 [1273] from Utkiavwĭñ is a very rude image, 2.6 inches
long, having a very small head and no arms. It is somewhat discolored
walrus ivory and quite dirty, and though evidently modern, from the
appearance of the ivory, does not appear to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page397" id = "page397">

not compare with the elegant figures in the museum from the more
southern parts of Alaska. The four remaining ivory carvings represent
the human face alone. No. 89342 [989], Fig. 396, from Nuwŭk, is a thick
piece of walrus ivory 3.3 inches long and 1.6 wide, carved into three
human faces, a&nbsp;man in the middle and a woman on each side, joined
together at the side of the head. Though the workmanship is rough, the
faces are characteristic. The man has labrets and a curved line of
tattooing at each corner of the mouth, indicating the successful
whaleman, and the women, the usual tattooing on the chin. The eyes,
nostrils, mouths, labrets, and tattooing are incised and blackened as
usual. This specimen, though apparently modern, does not seem fresh
enough to have been made for sale. The seller called it “a&nbsp;man and
his two wives” without giving them any names. It may be intended as a
portrait of some celebrated whaleman.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 397 is one of a pair of very rude faces (No. 56523 [52] from
Utkiavwĭñ), 1½ inches long, which were made for sale. It is simply a
walrus-tooth cut off square on the ends and on one side rudely carved
into a face, with the eyes and mouth incised and filled in with dark
colored dirt. Fig. 398 (No.&nbsp;89343 [1124] from Nuwŭk) is a flat
piece of ivory (a&nbsp;bit of an old snow shovel edge), 4&nbsp;inches
long and 1.2 inches wide, roughly carved and covered with incised
figures. The upper edge is carved into five heads: First, a&nbsp;rude
bear’s head, with the eyes and nostrils incised and blackened as usual;
then four human heads, with a face on each side. The front faces have
the noses and brows in low relief and the eyes, nostrils, and mouths
incised and blackened; the back ones are flat, with the last three
features indicated as before. At the end is a rude figure of a bear,
heading toward the right, with the ears in relief, the eyes and mouth
roughly incised and blackened, and the legs indicated by roughly incised
and blackened lines on the obverse face. Both faces are covered with
rudely incised and blackened lines.</p>

<p>On the obverse there is a single vertical line between each pair of
heads. Below the bear’s head is a bear heading toward the right;
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page398" id = "page398">

under the first human head, an umiak with four men; under the second,
a&nbsp;“killer” (Orca) heading toward the right; under the third, two of
the usual conventionalized whales’ tails suspended from a cross-line;
and under the last, a&nbsp;“killer” with very large “flukes” heading
toward the left.</p>

and under the bear’s head a bear heading toward the right. This end is
perforated with a large round hole, into which is knotted a bit of deer
sinew about 3 inches long, the other end of which is tied round the
junction of two little bowhead whales, each about 1 inch long and carved
out of a single piece of ivory, head to head. They are rather rudely
carved and have the spiracles incised and blackened. This object appears
freshly made, but perhaps commemorates the exploits of some four
hunters. It was purchased along with other objects and its history was
not learned at the time.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best image of a polar bear is No. 89566 [1252], Fig. 399,
from Utkiavwĭñ, which is quite characteristic. It represents the bear
standing and was carved out of soft, gray soapstone with a knife, and
finished off smoothly with a file. It is 4 inches long. No. 89571
[116<i>b</i>], from Nuwŭk, is a very rude flat soapstone bear, 1.9
inches long, in profile, showing only one fore and one hind leg. It was
made for sale, but No. 89576 [966], from the same village, which is
almost exactly like this, though smaller, is old. No. 89574 [1027], from
Nuwŭk, is the gypsum carving of a bear, above referred to, which is very
like
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page399" id = "page399">

<p>No. 89578 [1051], Fig. 400, from Utkiavwĭñ, is a thin profile figure
of a polar bear, made by flaking from dark gray flint. It is 1.4 inches
long, and the tail is disproportionately long. The specimen does not
appear to be new, and was perhaps intended for an amulet, like the flint
whales already mentioned.</p>

<p>The only bone figure of a bear in the collection, No. 89335 [1275],
Fig. 401<i>a</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ, is very crude. It has a very long,
slim body and neck, and short, slender legs. The mouth, eyes, and
nostrils are incised and are blackened as usual. The carving is rudely
done, but the specimen, which was made for sale, has been scraped
smooth. It is 5.5 inches long, and made of whale’s bone, soaked in oil
to make it appear old.</p>

<p>Fig. 401<i>b</i> (No. 89471 [997], from Utkiavwĭñ) is the end of some
old implement, 6&nbsp;inches long, one end of which is carved into a
rather rude bear’s head, with the ears, nostrils, outline of the mouth,
and the vibrissæ incised and blackened. Sky-blue glass beads are inlaid
for the eyes and bits of tooth for the canine tusks. On the throat is
<ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘a / a’ at linebreak">a</ins> conventional figure with two “circles and dots,” all
incised and blackened. The carving is freshly done, but soiled, to make
it look old.</p>

<p>The three newly made ivory bears are all represented standing and are
quite characteristic. All have the eyes, nostrils, and mouth incised and
blackened. Fig. 402<i>a</i> (No.&nbsp;89337 [1274], from Utkiavwĭñ) is
the best in execution. It is made of white ivory and is 3.3 inches long.
No. 56524, [92], from Nuwŭk, is a small bear, 1.7 inches long, not quite
so well carved, and disproportionally long-legged. The left hind leg has
been broken off close to the body and doweled on with a wooden peg.
Another little bear from Nuwŭk (No.&nbsp;89841 [992]) is still more
rudely carved, but closely resembles the preceding.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page400" id = "page400">

<p>A larger carving, rather roughly executed (No. 89338 [1098], from
Nuwŭk), represents a standing bear 3.2 inches long, holding a whale
crosswise in his mouth. The whale is a separate piece, held in by a
wooden peg driven through the bear’s lower jaw. This specimen is newly
made from rather coarse walrus ivory.</p>

<p>Fig. 402<i>b</i> (No. 89340 [953], from Utkiavwĭñ) is a very ancient
ivory image of a bear, 3.4 inches long, which was evidently intended for
an amulet, as there is a stout lug on the belly, into which are bored
two oblique holes, so as to make a longitudinal channel for a string.
Into this is knotted a stout cord of loosely twisted sinew. The
execution of the image is particularly good, but the design is very
rude. The specimen is so ancient that the ivory of which it is made has
become almost black.</p>

<p>No. 56528<i>a</i> [56<i>a</i>] from Utkiavwĭñ is a walrus tooth, 1.6
inches long, carved into the shape of a bear’s head. Both design and
execution are very rude. Light blue glass beads are inlaid for the eyes,
and the nostrils and outline of the mouth are incised and filled in with
black dirt. It was made for sale. A&nbsp;still more rude carving, also
made for sale, is No. 56528, from Utkiavwĭñ, which is an old and
weathered canine tooth of the polar bear, with the point freshly
whittled so as to look something like a bear’s head. Two sky-blue glass
beads are inlaid to represent the eyes and one for the nose, and the
mouth is incised and blackened.</p>

<p>The walrus does not appear to be a favorite subject for
representation. The part of the collection already described shows that
it occurs very seldom as a decoration, and we obtained only three images
of this animal, one in soapstone and two in ivory, all small and very
rude, both in design and execution. They are all newly made. The best
image is shown in Fig. 403<i>a</i> (No.&nbsp;89333 [1384] from
Utkiavwĭñ). This is 2.3 inches long and made of coarse walrus ivory. The
head is rather good, but the body simply tapers to a broken point.
A&nbsp;bit of wood is inlaid for the left eye, but the right is merely
represented by a hole.</p>

rude. The eyes, nostrils, and mouth are incised and blackened as usual,
and the vibrissæ (“whiskers”) are represented by rather large round pits
on the snout, also filled in with black dirt. It is 2.9 inches long, and
appears

<p>The best figure (No. 89330 [999] figured in the Point Barrow Rept.
Ethnol., Pl. <span class = "smallroman">V</span>, Fig. 6, from
Utkiavwĭñ) is carved from walrus ivory and is 4.3 inches long. It
represents a male rough seal, and is exceedingly accurate and highly
finished. The lower jaw is perforated and a bit of sinew thread tied in
to represent the drag line. Small red glass beads with white centers are
inlaid for the eyes. The other three are all of bone and represent dead
male seals stretched on their backs with the drag line in their jaw as
they are dragged home.</p>

<p>No. 56579 [75], Fig. 404<i>b</i>, from Utkiavwĭñ, is 5.7 inches long,
and very smoothly carved from walrus jaw bone, with round bits of wood
inlaid for the eyes. The proportions are excellent, but the details are
not strongly brought out. This specimen is a little older than the rest,
and may have been an amulet for good luck in seal catching. The other
two are of compact white bone, perhaps that of the reindeer.</p>

<p>No. 89331 [1143], from Utkiavwĭñ, is 3.4 inches long, and has the
breast and back flattened and the flippers in high relief. The anus,
genital opening, and eyes are incised, the latter two filled in, as
usual, with black dirt. The drag line is of sinew braid and has an ivory
cylinder slipped over it.</p>

<p>No. 89328 [1167], from Utkiavwĭñ, is the poorest in design. It is 5.6
inches long and has the neck bent up as in dragging. The back of a
freshly caught seal is always somewhat flattened by dragging it over the
ice, and this flattening is very much exaggerated in this carving by the
natural shape of the bone. The fore flippers are in high relief, with
three toes to each flipper, colored round the edge with red ocher. The
tips of the hind flippers are joined together, and each has only two
toes. The eyes, genital opening, and the spots on the back and belly are
indicated by shallow round pits colored with red ocher. The drag line is
a double bit of sinew braid, which has on it two ivory cylinders, one
ornamented with an incised pattern.</p>

subject for Eskimo artists farther south. This is the gypsum carving
already mentioned (No.&nbsp;89573 [1015], Fig. 405, from Nuwŭk). It is
3.5 inches long and is very characteristic, though rather short in
proportion to its girth. It was neatly carved with a knife.</p>

<p>The “bow-head” whale (Balæna mysticetus), is a very favorite subject,
appearing often as a decoration and represented by 21 carvings. Three of
these are of wood, very much resembling in design and execution the
harpoon boxes already described. They are all very old, and

perhaps were charms to be carried in the boat to secure good luck in
whaling. No. 89736 [857<i>b</i>], Fig. 406, from Utkiavwĭñ, is perhaps
the best proportioned of these figures, though the only details
represented are the flukes (which are broken), and the incised
spiracles. It is 5.4 inches long and made of spruce or hemlock, stained
almost black by dirt, grease, and weathering. A&nbsp;long string of

represent the left eye, and a similar piece appears to have been lost
from the right eye. The anus is represented by a light blue glass bead
inlaid in the belly. It is 8.8 inches long and made of soft wood,
probably cottonwood, weathered and stained to a dark brown. It is very
old and much chipped and cracked. Two small oblique holes in the middle
of the back make a transverse channel for a string. This specimen was

though neatly carved and scraped smooth. The spiracles and the outline
of the mouth are incised and little angular bits of brown quartz are
inlaid for the eyes. Both flukes have been split off and part of the
right fluke has been fastened on again with a single wooden treenail. It

correctly represented. It is 4.5 inches long, neatly carved from
soapstone, scraped smooth and oiled. It was made for sale. There are
five other round soapstone carvings of whales in the collection, but
none so good

as this except a little one from Nuwŭk, (No.&nbsp;89563 [986])
2&nbsp;inches long, which is almost an exact miniature of the preceding.
This specimen is not new. Fig. 408 (No.&nbsp;89557 [1267] from
Utkiavwĭñ) is a rude <i>flat</i> representation of a whale seen from
above. It is 5.2 inches long and roughly whittled out of the bottom of
an old stone pot. The flippers are large and clumsy, and the spiracles
slightly incised. The specimen appears to be old, as does a similar one
from Nuwŭk (No.&nbsp;89559 [1188<i>a</i>]).</p>

<p>No. 89558 [1266] from Utkiavwĭñ, and No. 89572 from Nuwŭk, both flat
images, are carelessly made for sale. The latter is simply a
representation in soapstone of the conventional “whale’s tail” with the
“small” cut off to an angular point. No. 89325 [1160] from Utkiavwĭñ is
a clumsy, broad whale with a flat belly, 4.1 inches long, freshly carved
from whale’s bone, and soaked in oil to make it look old. The eyes,
spiracles, and outline of the mouth are incised and filled in with dark
oil lees.</p>

<p>None of the ivory carvings of whales have any special artistic merit.
Fig. 409 (No.&nbsp;89323 [1024<i>a</i>] from Nuwŭk) is the best of
these. It is a little better in design and execution than the preceding,
which it resembles considerably. It is the female of a pair of little
whales made of old brown walrus ivory, which is much cracked. The male
differs from the female only in the shape of the external sexual organs,
the male having a little round pit and the female a long sulcus. This,
as well as the eyes, spiracles, and outline of the mouth, is incised and
filled in with dark colored dirt. The female is 3.1 inches long, the
male (No.&nbsp;89324 [1024<i>b</i>]) 0.1 inch longer. These specimens
appear to be quite ancient.</p>

but otherwise a very good representation, neatly carved. The flukes in
particular are especially well done, and the flippers are in high
relief. The eyes, the spiracles, and the outline of the mouth are
incised and the first blackened. The material is a rather poor quality
of walrus ivory, about half “core.” The specimen was made for sale. No.
89327 [991] from Nuwŭk was also made for sale. It is a little whale 1.6
inches long, rudely carved in walrus ivory.</p>

<p>Fig. 411 (No. 56619 [66] from Utkiavwĭñ) represents a pair of little
whales, each carved from a walrus tooth, which probably served for
buttons or toggles of some sort, though I do not recollect ever seeing
such objects in use. The belly of each is flat and has in the middle a
stout lug perforated with a transverse eye, and they are tied together
by a piece of thong about 14 inches long. They are quite well designed
and executed, but rather “stumpy” in outline, with the outline of the
mouth and the spiracles incised and blackened, and little round bits of
tooth inlaid for eyes. In the middle of the back of each was inlaid a
small blue glass bead, which still remains in one of them. They are old
and dirty and somewhat chipped about the flukes.</p>

and a human head, with the eyes and mouth incised. It is roughly carved
from light gray soapstone, and ground pretty smooth. This figure is not
new, and has probably connected with it some story which we did not
succeed in learning. The seller called it an “old man.” No. 89332 [994]
from Nuwŭk, is a fanciful monster, 4.2 inches long, carved in ivory. It
has a human head with the tusks of a walrus, the body, tail, and
flippers of a seal, with human arms. The hands, each of which has four
fingers, clasp some round object against the belly. It is not old, but
apparently was not made

which is interesting from its resemblance to one of the fabulous animals
which figure in the Greenland legends. It is 4 inches long and
represents a long-necked bear with ten legs, an animal which the maker
gave us to understand had once been seen at Point Barrow. The
resemblance of this animal to the “kiliopak” or “kilifvak” of the
Greenland stories, which is described as “an animal with six or even ten

<p>Fig. 415 (No. 89723 [1084] from Nuwŭk) is another representation of
the giant who holds a whale in each hand. He was called in this instance
“Kaióasu,” and not “Kikámigo.” This image is carved from very old pale
brown walrus ivory, and is 2.3 inches high. A&nbsp;transverse incised
line across each cheek from the wing of the nose, indicates the
whaleman’s tattoo mark of the Eastern fashion. The image is ancient, but
is mounted in a socket in the middle of a newly made wooden stand, which
has a broad border of red ocher and a broad streak of the same paint
along each diameter.</p>

<p>Fig. 416 (No. 89336 [1369]) is a curious piece of carving, which

The carving is well executed and really seems to be old, although it has
evidently been retouched in a good many places. It is made from an
irregularly flattened bit of reindeer antler, 3.6 inches long, blackened
by the weather on the flat surfaces, and represents an animal with four
legs, which appear to be dog’s legs, and at each end what appears to be
a dog’s head. One of these is smaller than the other and both have the
ears in relief, and the eyes, nostrils, and outlines of the mouth
incised.</p>

carnivorous animal, made of ivory, and 2.6 inches long, fitted to the
broad end of a flat pointed wooden handle, painted red. The head was
called a “dog”, but it looks more like a bear. Small bits of wood are
inlaid for the eyes, and the outline of the mouth is deeply incised and
colored with red ocher, having bits of white ivory inlaid to represent
the canine teeth. The ears, nostrils, vibrissæ, and hairs on the muzzle
are indicated by blackened incisions. There is an ornamented collar
round the neck, to which is joined a conventional pattern of triangular
form on the throat, and a somewhat similar pattern on the top of the
head between the ears.</p>

<p>One of the natives at Utkiavwĭñ, in May, 1882, conceived the fancy of
smoothing off the tip of a walrus tusk into the shape of a pyramid,
surmounted by a little conical cap and ornamenting it with incised
figures, which he colored with red ocher. It appears to have been purely
an individual fancy, as it has no utility, nor are such objects made by
the Eskimo elsewhere, as far as I know. Having succeeded in finding a
sale for this object, either he or one of his friends, I&nbsp;do not

<p>Fig. 420 (No. 89741 [1012] from Nuwŭk) is an ivory cross 15.5 inches
long. The cross is ornamented by incised rings and dots colored with red
ocher. The shaft of the cross is surmounted by a female human head
neatly carved from soapstone, fastened on by a lashing of sinew braid,
which passes through a transverse hole in the head and round the
crosspiece. No. 89742 [1091], also from Nuwŭk, closely resembles the
preceding, but is slightly shorter and has a four-sided shaft. The head,
moreover, which is made of bone, represents a man, as is shown by the
little pits, which indicate the labrets. The cheeks and crown of the
head are colored slightly red with red ocher.</p>

<p>The ingenious Yöksa, so often mentioned, made the first image and
brought it down for sale. All he could or would tell us about it was
that it was “tună´ktûp kuni´a,” “A&nbsp;kuni´a (jargon for woman) of
soapstone.” The successful sale of this first cross encouraged him to
make the second, but we saw no others before or after. Other natives who
saw these objects only laughed. The whole may be simply a fanciful doll,
perhaps meant for a caricature, the shaft representing the body, and the
crosspiece the outstretched arms. The object is very suggestive of a
crucifix, and there is a bare possibility that the maker may have seen
something of the sort in the possession of some of the eastern natives
who have been visited by a missionary of the Roman Catholic Church
(Father Petitot).</p>

<p>Under the head of works of art may properly be included No. 89823
[1130], from Utkiavwĭñ. This is the skeleton of the jaws of a polar
bear, cut off just back of the nose, neatly sewed up in a piece of
sealskin with the hair out, so as to leave uncovered only the tips of
the jawbones and the canine teeth. This specimen was put up by the same
quick-witted young native after his removal from Nuwŭk to Utkiavwĭñ,
evidently in imitation of the work of preparing specimens of natural
history, which he had seen done at the station. For the same reason he
dried and carefully preserved in a little box whittled out of a block of
wood and tied up with sinew a little fresh-water sculpin (Cottus
quadricornis), which he had caught at Kulugrua (No.&nbsp;89536
[1145]).</p>

<p>I regret much that we did not save and bring home any of the pencil
drawings made by these people. The children especially were anxious to
get lead pencils, and made themselves rather a nuisance by covering the
painted walls of the observatory with scrawls of ships and various other
objects, perhaps rather more accurately done than they would have been
by white children of the same age. The style of the figures on the
hunting scores already described, however, is very like that of the

<p>As far as we could learn, the marriage relation was entered upon
generally from reasons of interest or convenience, with very little
regard for affection, as we understand it, though there often appeared
to be a warm attachment between married people. A&nbsp;man desires to
obtain a wife who will perform her household duties well and faithfully,
and will be at the same time an agreeable companion, while he often
plans to marry into a rich or influential family. The woman, on the
other hand, appears to desire a husband who is industrious and a good
hunter. There were, nevertheless, some indications that real love
matches sometimes took place. Marriages are usually arranged by the
parents of the contracting parties, sometimes when the principals are
mere children. We knew of one case when a young man of about twenty-two
offered himself as the prospective husband of a girl of eight or ten,
when she should reach a marriageable age. This practice of child
betrothal seems to be practically universal among the Eskimo
everywhere.<a class = "tag" name = "tag520" id = "tag520" href =
"#note520">520</a></p>

<p>Dr. Simpson, in describing the marriage customs at Point Barrow,
says:</p>

<blockquote>
The usual case is, that as soon as the young man desires a partner and
is able to support one, his mother selects a girl according to her
judgment or fancy, and invites her to the hut, where she first takes the
part of a “kivgak” or servant, having all the cooking and other kitchen
duties to perform during the day, and returns to her home at night. If
her conduct proves satisfactory, she is further invited to become a
member of the family.<a class = "tag" name = "tag521" id = "tag521" href
= "#note521">521</a></blockquote>

<p>We only knew this to be done on one occasion; and on the contrary
knew of several cases where the bridegroom became a member of the wife’s
family.</p>

<p>One youth, who had had his lips pierced for the labrets just
previously to our arrival, was, we soon learned, betrothed to a young
girl at Nuwŭk. This girl frequently came down from Nuwŭk and visited her
lover’s family, staying several days at a time, but we could not
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page411" id = "page411">
411</a></span>
discover that she was treated as a servant. She went with them to the
spring deer hunt, but we were distinctly given to understand that the
young couple would not be married till after the return from this hunt,
and that no intercourse would take place between them before that time.
When the season came for catching reindeer fawns, the couple started off
together, with sled and dogs and camp equipage in pursuit of them, and
always afterwards were considered as man and wife.</p>

<p>Most of the marriages took place before we heard of them, so that we
had no opportunity for learning what ceremony, if any, occurred at the
time. Some of the party, however, who went over to make a visit at
Utkiavwĭñ one evening, found the house full of people, who were singing
and dancing, and were told that this was to celebrate the marriage of
the daughter of the house. Marriage ceremonies appear to be rare among
the Eskimo. A&nbsp;pretended abduction, with the consent of the parents,
is spoken of by Bessels at Smith Sound<a class = "tag" name = "tag522"
id = "tag522" href = "#note522">522</a> and Egede in Greenland
(p.&nbsp;142), and Kumlien was informed that certain ceremonies were
sometimes practiced at Cumberland Gulf.<a class = "tag" name = "tag523"
id = "tag523" href = "#note523">523</a> Elsewhere I have not been able
to find any reference to the subject. A&nbsp;man usually selects a wife
of about his own age, but reasons of interest sometimes lead to a great
disparity of age between the two. I&nbsp;do not recollect any case where
an old man had a wife very much younger than himself, but we knew of
several men who had married widows or divorced women old enough to be
their mothers,<a class = "tag" name = "tag524" id = "tag524" href =
"#note524">524</a> and in one remarkable case the bride was a girl of
sixteen or seventeen, and the husband a lad apparently not over
thirteen, who could barely have reached the age of puberty.</p>

<p>This couple were married late in the winter of 1882-’83, and
immediately started off to the rivers, deer hunting, where the young
husband was very successful. This union, however, appeared to have been
dissolved in the summer, as I believe the girl was living with another
and older man when we left the station. In this case, the husband came
to live with the wife’s family.</p>

<p>As is the case with most Eskimo, most of the men content themselves
with one wife, though a few of the wealthy men have two each. I&nbsp;do
not recollect over half a dozen men in the two villages who had more
than one wife each, and one of these dismissed his younger wife during
our stay. We never heard of a case of more than two wives. As well as we
could judge, the marriage bond was regarded simply as a contract entered
into by the agreement of the contracting parties and, without any formal
ceremony of divorce, easily dissolved in the same way, on account of
incompatibility of temper, or even on account of temporary
disagreements.</p>

<p>We knew of one or two cases where wives left their husbands on
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page412" id = "page412">
412</a></span>
account of ill treatment. One of these cases resulted in a permanent
separation, each of the couple finally marrying again, though the
husband for a long time tried his best to get his wife to come back to
him. In another case, where the wife after receiving a beating ran away
to Nuwŭk, and, as we were told, married another man, her first husband
followed her in a day or two and either by violence or persuasion made
her come back with him. They afterwards appeared to live together on
perfectly good terms.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we know of several cases where men discarded wives
who were unsatisfactory or made themselves disagreeable. For instance,
the younger Tuñazu, when we first made his acquaintance, was married to
a widow very much his senior, who seemed to have a disagreeable and
querulous temper, so that we were not surprised to hear in the spring of
1882 that they were separated and Tuñazu married to a young girl. His
second matrimonial venture was no more successful than his first, for
his young wife proved to be a great talker. As he told us: “She talked
all the time, so that he could not eat and could not sleep.” So he
discarded her, and when we left the station he had been for some time
married to another old widow.</p>

<p>In the case above mentioned, where the man with two wives discarded
the younger of them, the reason he assigned was that she was lazy, would
not make her own clothes, and was disobedient to the older wife, to whom
he was much attached. As he said, Kakaguna (the older wife) told her,
“Give me a drink of water,” and she said, “No!” so Kakaguna said, “Go!”
and she went. He did not show any particular concern about it.</p>

<p>Dr. Simpson says, “A great many changes take place before a permanent
choice is made;” and again, “A&nbsp;union once apparently settled
between parties grown up is rarely dissolved.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag525" id = "tag525" href = "#note525">525</a> And this agrees with
our experience. The same appears to have been the case in Greenland.
Crantz<a class = "tag" name = "tag526" id = "tag526" href =
"#note526">526</a> says, “Such quarrels and separations only happen
between people in their younger years, who have married without due
forethought. The older they grow, the more they love one another.”</p>

<p>Easy and unceremonious divorce appears to be the usual custom among
Eskimo generally, and the divorced parties are always free to marry
again.<a class = "tag" name = "tag527" id = "tag527" href =
"#note527">527</a> The only writer who mentions any ceremony of divorce
is Bessels, who witnessed such among the so-called “Arctic Highlanders”
of Smith Sound (Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p.&nbsp;877). Dr. Simpson,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page413" id = "page413">
413</a></span>
in the paragraph referred to above, says that “A&nbsp;man of mature age
chooses a wife for himself and fetches her home, frequently, to all
appearance, much against her will.” The only case of the kind which came
to our notice was in 1883, when one of the Kĭlauwitawĭñmeun attempted by
blows to coerce Adwû´na, an Utkiavwĭñ girl, to live with him, but was
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>A curious custom, not peculiar to these people, is the habit of
exchanging wives temporarily. For instance, one man of our acquaintance
planned to go to the rivers deer hunting in the summer of 1882, and
borrowed his cousin’s wife for the expedition, as she was a good shot
and a good hand at deer hunting, while his own wife went with his cousin
on the trading expedition to the eastward. On their return the wives
went back to their respective husbands.</p>

<p>The couples sometimes find themselves better pleased with their new
mates than with the former association, in which case the exchange is
made permanent. This happened once in Utkiavwĭñ to our certain
knowledge. This custom has been observed at Fury and Hecla Straits,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag528" id = "tag528" href = "#note528">528</a>
Cumberland Gulf,<a class = "tag" name = "tag529" id = "tag529" href =
"#note529">529</a> and in the region around Repulse Bay, where it seems
to be carried to an extreme.</p>

<p>According to Gilder<a class = "tag" name = "tag530" id = "tag530"
href = "#note530">530</a> it is a usual thing among friends in that
region to exchange wives for a week or two about every two months. Among
the Greenlanders the only custom of the kind mentioned is the temporary
exchange of wives at certain festivals described by Egede.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag531" id = "tag531" href = "#note531">531</a></p>

<p>Holm also describes “the game of putting out the lamps,” or “changing
wives,” as a common winter sport in East Greenland. He also, however,
speaks of the temporary exchange of wives among these people much as
described elsewhere.<a class = "tag" name = "tag532" id = "tag532" href
= "#note532">532</a></p>

<p>I am informed by some of the whalemen who winter in the neighborhood
of Repulse Bay, that at certain times there is a general exchange of
wives throughout the village, each woman passing from man to man till
she has been through the hands of all, and finally returns to her
husband. All these cases seem to me to indicate that the Eskimo have not
wholly emerged from the state called communal marriage, in which each
woman is considered as the wife of every man in the community.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "domestic_women" id = "domestic_women" href

<p>The women appear to stand on a footing of perfect equality with the
men both in the family and in the community. The wife is the constant
and trusted companion of the man in everything except the hunt, and her
opinion is sought in every bargain or other important undertaking.<a

<p>Dr. Simpson’s description<a class = "tag" name = "tag534" id =
"tag534" href = "#note534">534</a> of the standing of the women at Point
Barrow in his time is so true at the present day that I may be pardoned
for quoting the whole of it:</p>

<blockquote>
A man seems to have unlimited authority in his own hut, but, as with few
exceptions his rule is mild, the domestic and social position of the
women is one of comfort and enjoyment. As there is no affected dignity
or importance in the men, they do not make mere slaves and drudges of
the women; on the contrary, they endure their full share of fatigue and
hardship in the coldest season of the year, only calling in the
assistance of the women if too wearied themselves to bring in the fruits
of their own industry and patience; and at other seasons the women
appear to think it a privation not to share the labors of the men.
A&nbsp;woman’s ordinary occupations are sewing, the preparation of skins
for making and mending, cooking, and the general care of the supplies of
provisions. Occasionally in the winter she is sent out on the ice for a
seal which her husband has taken, to which she is guided by his
footmarks; and in spring and summer she takes her place in the boat if
required.</blockquote>


<p>The statement in the first sentence that the husband’s rule is mild
is hardly consistent with that on the following page that “obedience
seems to be the great virtue required, and is enforced by blows when
necessary, until the man’s authority is established.” According to our
experience the first statement is nearer the truth. We heard of few
cases of wife-beating, and those chiefly among the younger men. Two
brothers, who habitually ill-treated their wives, were looked upon with
disfavor, by some of our friends at least. We heard of one case where a
stalwart wife turned the tables on her husband who attempted to abuse
her, giving him a thorough beating and then leaving his house.</p>

<p>Wife-beating was not uncommon among the Greenlanders.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag535" id = "tag535" href = "#note535">535</a> We did not learn
whether a woman brought anything like a dowry, but Simpson<a class =
"tag" name = "tag536" id = "tag536" href = "#note536">536</a> says: “The
woman’s property, consisting of her beads and other ornaments, her
needlecase, knife, etc., are considered her own; and if a separation
takes place the clothes and presents are returned and she merely takes
away with her whatever she brought.” According to Crantz<a class = "tag"
name = "tag537" id = "tag537" href = "#note537">537</a> a&nbsp;widow in
Greenland had no share of her husband’s property, but owns only what she
brought with her, and I am inclined to believe that this is the case at
Point Barrow.</p>

<p>One widow of my acquaintance, who appeared to have no relatives in
the village, was reduced almost to beggary, though her husband had been
quite well-to-do. All his property and even his boy were taken from her
by some of the other natives. Widows who have well-to-do relatives,
especially grown-up sons, are well taken care of and often marry again.
According to Captain Parry,<a class = "tag" name = "tag538" id =
"tag538" href = "#note538">538</a> unprotected widows were robbed at
Iglulik.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "domestic_children" id =
"domestic_children" href = "#domestic">Children.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>From the small number of births which occurred during our stay at
Point Barrow, we were able to ascertain little in regard to this
subject. When a woman is about to be confined, she is isolated in
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page415" id = "page415">
415</a></span>
a little snow hut in winter or a little tent in summer, in which she
remains for some time&mdash;just how long we were unable to learn.
Captain Herendeen saw a pregnant woman in Utkiavwĭñ engaged, on March
31, in building a little snow house, which she told him was meant for
her confinement, but she had evidently somehow miscalculated her time,
as her child was not born till much later, when the people had moved
into the tents. She and her child lived in a little tent on the beach
close to her husband’s tent, evidently in a sitting position, as the
tent was not large enough for her to lie down in. Her husband was
desirous of going off on the summer deer hunt, but, under the
circumstances, custom forbade his leaving the neighborhood of the
village till the ice at sea broke up. The same custom of isolating the
women during childbirth has been observed by Kumlien and Boas at
Cumberland Gulf<a class = "tag" name = "tag539" id = "tag539" href =
"#note539">539</a>, and in Greenland the mother was not allowed to eat
or drink in the open air.<a class = "tag" name = "tag540" id = "tag540"
href = "#note540">540</a> Lisiansky describes a similar practice in
Kadiak in 1805,<a class = "tag" name = "tag541" id = "tag541" href =
"#note541">541</a> and Klutschak also notes it among the Aivillirmiut.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag542" id = "tag542" href =
"#note542">542</a></p>

<p>The custom of shutting up the mother and child in a snow house in
winter must be very dangerous to the infant, and, in fact, the only
child that was born in winter during our stay lived but a short time.
Capt. Herendeen visited this family at Nuwŭk shortly after the death of
the child, and saw the snow house in which the woman had been confined.
He was about to take a drink of water from a dipper which he saw in the
iglu, but was prevented by the other people, who told him that this
belonged to the mother and that it was “bad” for anyone else to use it.
In Greenland the mother had a separate water pail.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag543" id = "tag543" href = "#note543">543</a> For a time, our
visitors from Utkiavwĭñ were very much afraid to drink out of the tin
pannikin in our washroom, for fear it had been used by Niăksăra,
a&nbsp;woman who had recently suffered a miscarriage. One man told us
that a sore on his face was caused by his having inadvertently done so.
This same woman was forbidden to go out among the broken ice of the land
floe, during the spring succeeding her miscarriage, though she might go
out on the smooth shore ice. Her husband also was forbidden to work with
a hammer or adz or to go seal-catching for some time after the
mishap.</p>

<p>Children are nursed until they are 3 or 4 years old, according to
what appears to be the universal habit among Eskimo, and which is
probably due, as generally supposed, to the fact that the animal food on
which the parents subsist is not fit for the nourishment of young
children. The child is carried naked on the mother’s back under her
clothes, and held up by the girdle, tied higher than usual. When she
wishes to nurse it, she loosens her girdle and slips it round to the
breast
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page416" id = "page416">
416</a></span>
without bringing it out into the air. Children are carried in this way
until they are able to walk and often later.</p>

<p>A large child sits astride of his mother’s back, with one leg under
each of her arms, and has a little suit of clothes in which he is
dressed when the mother wishes to set him down. When the child is awake,
this hood is thrown back and the child raised quite high so that he
looks over his mother’s shoulder, who then covers her head with a cloth
or something of the sort. The woman appears to be very little
inconvenienced by her burden, and goes about her work as usual, and the
child does not seem to be disturbed by her movements. The little girls
often act as nurses and carry the infants around on their backs, in the
same way. It is no unusual sight to see a little girl of ten or twelve
carrying a well grown, heavy child in this way.</p>

<p>This custom or a very similar one seems to prevail among the Eskimo
generally. In Greenland, the nurse wears a garment especially designed
for carrying the child, an amaut, i.e., a&nbsp;garment that is so wide
in the back as to hold a child, which generally tumbles in it quite
naked and is accommodated with no other swaddling clothes or cradle.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag544" id = "tag544" href = "#note544">544</a> In
East Greenland, according to Capt. Holm, “Saa længe Børnene ere smaa,
bæres de i det fri paa Moderens Ryg.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag545" id
= "tag545" href = "#note545">545</a></p>

<p>Petitot’s description of the method of carrying the children in the
Mackenzie district is so naïve that it deserves to be quoted entire.<a

<blockquote>
Les mères qui allaitent portent une jaquette ample et serrée autour des
reins par une ceinture. Elles y enferment leur chère progéniture
qu’elles peuvent, par ce moyen, allaiter sans l’exposer à un froid qui
lui serait mortel. Ces jeunes enfants sont sans aucun vêtement jusqu’à
l’âge d’environ deux ans. Quant aux incongruités que ces petites
créatures peuvent se permettre sur le dos de leur mère, qui leur sert de
calorifère, l’amour maternel, le même chez tous les peuples, les endure
patiemment et avec indifférence.</blockquote>


<p>At Fury and Hecla Straits, according to Parry<a class = "tag" name =
"tag547" id = "tag547" href = "#note547">547</a>, the children are
carried in the hood, which is made specially large on purpose, but
sometimes also on the back, as at Point Barrow. The enormous hoods of
the Eskimo women in Labrador also served to hold the child. The same
custom prevails at Cumberland Gulf.<a class = "tag" name = "tag548" id =
"tag548" href = "#note548">548</a> In some localities, for instance the
north shore of Hudson’s Straits, where the woman wear very long and
loose boots, the children are said to be carried in these.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag549" id = "tag549" href = "#note549">549</a> Franklin<a
class = "tag" name = "tag550" id = "tag550" href = "#note550">550</a>
refers to the same custom “east of the Mackenzie River.” The Siberian
children, however, are dressed in regular swaddling clothes of deerskin,
with a sort of diaper of dried moss.<a class = "tag" name = "tag551" id
= "tag551" href = "#note551">551</a></p>

<p>We never heard of a single case of infanticide, and, indeed, children
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page417" id = "page417">
417</a></span>
were so scarce and seemed so highly prized that we never even thought of
inquiring if infanticide was ever practiced. Nevertheless, Simpson
speaks of the occurrence of a case during the Plover’s visit; “but a
child, they say, is destroyed only when afflicted with disease of a
fatal tendency, or, in scarce seasons, when one or both parents die.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag552" id = "tag552" href = "#note552">552</a>”
Infanticide, according to Bessels, is frequently practiced among the
Eskimo of Smith Sound, without regard of sex,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag553" id = "tag553" href = "#note553">553</a> and Schwatka speaks of
female infanticide to a limited extent among the people of King
William’s Land.<a class = "tag" name = "tag554" id = "tag554" href =
"#note554">554</a></p>

<p>The affection of parents for their children is extreme, and the
children seem to be thoroughly worthy of it. They show hardly a trace of
the fretfulness and petulance so common among civilized children, and
though indulged to an extreme extent are remarkably obedient. Corporal
punishment appears to be absolutely unknown and the children are rarely
chidden or punished in any way. Indeed, they seldom deserve it, for, in
spite of the freedom which they are allowed, they do not often get into
any mischief, especially of a malicious sort, but attend quietly to
their own affairs and their own amusements.</p>

<p>The older children take very good care of the smaller ones. It is an
amusing sight to see a little boy of six or seven patronizing and
protecting a little toddler of two or three. Children rarely cry except
from actual pain or terror, and even then little ones are remarkably
patient and plucky. The young children appear to receive little or no
instruction except what they pick up in their play or from watching
their elders.</p>

<p>Boys of six or seven begin to shoot small birds and animals and to
hunt for birds’ eggs, and when they reach the age of twelve or fourteen
are usually intrusted with a gun and seal spear and accompany their
fathers to the hunt. Some of them soon learn to be very skillful
hunters. We know one boy not over thirteen years old who, during the
winter of 1881-’82, had his seal nets set like the men and used to visit
them regularly, even in the roughest weather. Lads of fourteen or
fifteen are sometimes regular members of the whaling crews. In the
meantime the little girls are learning to sew, in imitation of their
mothers, and by the time they are twelve years old they take their share
of the cooking and other housework and assist in making the clothes for
the family. They still, however, have plenty of leisure to play with the
other children until they are old enough to be married.</p>

<p>Affection for their children seems a universal trait among the Eskimo
and there is scarcely an author who does not speak in terms of
commendation of the behavior and disposition of the Eskimo children.
Some of these passages are so applicable to the people of Point Barrow
that I can not forbear quoting them. Egede says:<a class = "tag" name =
"tag555" id = "tag555" href = "#note555">555</a></p>

<blockquote>
They have a very tender Love for their Children, and the Mother always
carries the infant Child about with her upon her back. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
They suck them till they are
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page418" id = "page418">
418</a></span>
three or four years old or more, because, in their tender Infancy, they
cannot digest the strong Victuals that the rest must live upon. The
Education of their Children is what they seem little concerned about,
for they never make use of whipping or hard words to correct them when
they do anything amiss, but leave them to their own Discretion.
Notwith&shy;standing which, when they are grown, they never seem
inclined to Vice or Roguery, which is to be admired. It is true, they
show no great Respect to their Parents in any outward Forms, but always
are very willing to do what they order them, though sometimes they will
bid their Parents do it themselves.</blockquote>


<p>According to Capt. Holm,<a class = "tag" name = "tag556" id =
"tag556" href = "#note556">556</a> in East Greenland, “De opvoxe i den
mest ubundne Frihed. Forældrene nære en ubeskrivelig Kjærlighed til dem
og straffe dem derfor aldrig, selv om de ere nok saa gjenstridige. Man
maa imidlertid beundre, hvor velopdragne de smaa alligevel ere.”</p>

<p>Parry speaks still more strongly:<a class = "tag" name = "tag557" id
= "tag557" href = "#note557">557</a></p>

<blockquote>
The affection of parents for their children was frequently displayed by
these people, not only in the mere passive indulgence and abstinence
from corporal punishment for which Esquimaux have been before remarked,
but by a thousand playful endearments also, such as parents and nurses
practice in our own country. Nothing, indeed can well exceed the
kindness with which they treat their children. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It must
be confessed, indeed, that the gentleness and docility of the children
are such as to occasion their parents little trouble and to render
severity towards them quite unnecessary. Even from their earliest
infancy, they possess that quiet disposition, gentleness of demeanor,
and uncommon evenness of temper, for which in more mature age they are
for the most part distinguished. Disobedience is scarcely ever known;
a&nbsp;word or even a look from a parent is enough; and I never saw a
single instance of that frowardness and disposition to mischief which,
in our youth, so often requires the whole attention of a parent to watch
over and to correct. They never cry from trifling accidents, and
sometimes not even from very severe hurts, at which an English child
would sob for an hour. It is, indeed, astonishing to see the
indifference with which, even as tender infants, they bear the numerous
blows they accidentally receive when carried at their mothers’
backs.</blockquote>


<p>I should be willing to allow this passage to stand as a description
of the Point Barrow children. It is interesting to compare with these
passages Nordenskiöld’s account<a class = "tag" name = "tag558" id =
"tag558" href = "#note558">558</a> of the children at Pitlekaj, who, if
not as he and other writers believe, of pure Chukch blood, are at any
rate of mixed Chukch and Eskimo descent:</p>

<blockquote>
The children are neither chastised nor scolded. They are, however, the
best behaved I have ever seen. Their behavior in the tent is equal to
that of the best brought up European children in the parlor. They are
not perhaps so wild as ours, but are addicted to games which closely
resemble those common among us in the country. Playthings are also in
use. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* If the parents get any delicacy they always give
each of their children a bit, and there is never any quarrel as to the
size of each child’s portion. If a piece of sugar is given to one of the
children in a crowd it goes from mouth to mouth round the whole company.
In the same way the child offers its father and mother a taste of the
bit of sugar or piece of bread it has got. Even in childhood the Chukchs
are exceedingly patient. A&nbsp;girl who fell down from the ship’s
stairs head foremost and thus got so violent a blow that she was almost
deprived of hearing scarcely uttered a cry. A&nbsp;boy three or four
years of age, much rolled up in furs, who fell down into a ditch cut in
the ice on the ship’s deck, and in consequence of his inconvenient dress
could not get up, lay quietly still until he was observed and helped up
by one of the crew.</blockquote>


<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page419" id = "page419">
419</a></span>
<p>The only extraordinary thing about the Chukch children is their large
number, mentioned by the same author.<a class = "tag" name = "tag559" id
= "tag559" href = "#note559">559</a> This looks as if the infusion of
new blood had increased the fertility of the race. All authors who have
described Eskimo of unmixed descent agree in regard to the generally
small number of their offspring. Other accounts of Eskimo children are
to be found in the writings of Bessels,<a class = "tag" name = "tag560"
id = "tag560" href = "#note560">560</a> Crantz,<a class = "tag" name =

"tag565" href = "#note565">565</a></p>

<p>The custom of adoption is as universal at Point Barrow as it appears
to be among the Eskimo generally, and the adopted children are treated
by the parents precisely as if they were their own flesh and blood.
Orphans are readily provided for, as there are always plenty of families
ready and willing to take them, and women who have several children
frequently give away one or more of them. Families that have nothing but
boys often adopt a girl, and, of course, vice versa, and we know of one
case where a woman who had lost a young infant had another given her by
one of her friends.</p>

<p>This very general custom of giving away children, as well as the
habit already mentioned of temporarily exchanging wives, rendered it
quite difficult to ascertain the parentage of any person, especially as
it seems to be the custom with them to speak of first cousins as “mĭlu
ataúzĭk” (“one breast,” that is, brothers and sisters). While a boy is
desired in the family, since he will be the support of his father when
the latter grows too old to hunt, a&nbsp;girl is almost as highly
prized, for not only will she help her mother with the cares of
housekeeping when she grows up, but she is likely to obtain a good
husband who may be induced to become a member of his father-in-law’s
family.<a class = "tag" name = "tag566" id = "tag566" href =
"#note566">566</a></p>


<h4><a name = "rights" id = "rights" href = "#top">RIGHTS AND
WRONGS.</a></h4>

<p>I have already spoken of the feelings of these people in regard to
offenses against property and crimes of violence. As to the relations
between the sexes there seems to be the most complete absence of what we
consider moral feelings. Promiscuous sexual intercourse between married
or unmarried people, or even among children, appears to be looked upon
simply as a matter for amusement. As far as we could learn unchastity in
a girl was considered nothing against her, and in fact one girl who was
a most abandoned and shameless prostitute among the sailors, and who, we
were told, had had improper relations with some of her own race, had no
difficulty in obtaining an excellent husband.</p>

<p>Remarks of the most indecent character are freely bandied back and
forth between the sexes in public, and are received with shouts of
laughter by the bystanders. Nevertheless, some of the women, especially
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page420" id = "page420">
420</a></span>
those of the wealthier class, preserve a very tolerable degree of
conjugal fidelity and certainly do not prostitute themselves to the
sailors. I&nbsp;believe that prostitution for gain is unknown among
themselves, but it is carried to a most shameless extent with the
sailors of the whaling fleet by many of the women, and is even
considered a laudable thing by the husbands and fathers, who are
perfectly willing to receive the price of their wives’ or daughters’
frailty, especially if it takes the form of liquor. Dr. Simpson<a class
= "tag" name = "tag567" id = "tag567" href = "#note567">567</a> says:
“It is said by themselves that the women are very continent before
marriage, as well as faithful afterward to their husbands; and this
seems to a certain extent true.” But he goes on to add: “In their
conduct toward strangers the elderly women frequently exhibit a
shameless want of modesty, and the men an equally shameless
indifference, except for the reward of their partner’s frailty.” It
seems to me that he must have been deceived by the natives concerning
the first statement, since the immorality of these people among
themselves, as we witnessed it, seems too purely animal and natural to
be of recent growth or the result of foreign influence. Moreover,
a&nbsp;similar state of affairs has been observed among Eskimo
elsewhere, notably at Iglulik at the time of Parry’s visit.<a class =

<p>Though the idea of cleanliness among these people differs
considerably from our ideas, they are as a rule far from being as filthy
as they appear at first sight. Considering the difficulty of obtaining
water, even for purposes of drinking, in the winter season, the iglu,
unless dirty work, like the dressing of skins, etc., is going on, is
kept remarkably clean. The floor and walls are scrupulously scraped and
all dirt is immediately wiped up. They are particularly careful not to
bring in any snow or dirt on their feet, and the snow and hoar frost is
carefully brushed off from the outer garment, which is often removed
before entering the room and left in the passage. They are also careful
not to spit on the floor or in the passage, but use for this purpose the
large urine tub. This is practically the only offensive object in the
house, as it is freely used by both sexes in the presence of the rest.
This is done, however, with less exposure and immodesty than one would
suppose.<a class = "tag" name = "tag569" id = "tag569" href =
"#note569">569</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page421" id = "page421">
421</a></span>
<p>The contents of this vessel, being mixed with feces, is not fit for
tanning skins, etc., and is consequently thrown out doors. The men use a
small tub (kuovwĭñ) as a urinal, and the contents of this is carefully
saved. Though the interior of the house is thus kept clean, as much can
not be said for its surroundings. All manner of rubbish and filth is
simply thrown out upon the ground, without regard to decency or comfort,
and this becomes exceedingly offensive when the snow melts in summer.
The only scavengers are the dogs, who greedily devour old pieces of
skin, refuse meat, and even feces. In regard to personal cleanliness,
there is considerable difference between individuals. Some people,
especially the poorer women and children, are not only careless about
their clothes, going about dressed in ragged, greasy, filthy garments,
but seldom wash even their faces and hands, much less their whole
persons. One of these women, indeed, was described by her grown-up
daughter as “That woman with the black on her nose.”</p>

<p>On the other hand most of the wealthier people appear to take pride
in being neatly clad, and, except when actually engaged in some dirty
work, always have their faces and hands, at least, scrupulously clean
and their hair neatly combed. Even the whole person is sometimes washed
in spite of the scarcity of water. Many are glad to get soap (íɐkăkun)
and use it freely. Lieut. Ray says that his two guides, Mû´ñialu and
Apaidyào, at the end of a day’s march would never sit down to supper
without washing their faces and hands with soap and water, and combing
their hair, and I recollect that once, when I went over to the village
to get a young man to start with Lieut. Ray on a boat journey, he would
not start until he had hunted up a piece of soap and washed his face and
hands. These people, of course, practice the usual Eskimo habit of
washing themselves with freshly passed urine. This custom arises not
only from the scarcity of water and the difficulty of heating it, but
from the fact that the ammonia of the urine is an excellent substitute
for soap in removing the grease with which the skin necessarily becomes
soiled.<a class = "tag" name = "tag570" id = "tag570" href =
"#note570">570</a> This fact is well known to our whalemen, who are in
the habit of saving their urine to wash the oily clothes with. The same
habit is practiced by the “Chukches” of eastern Siberia.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag571" id = "tag571" href = "#note571">571</a> All, however,
get more or less shabby and dirty in the summer, when they are living in
tents and boats. All are more or less infested with lice, and they are
in the habit of searching each others’ heads for these, which they eat,
after the fashion of so many other savages. They have also another
filthy habit&mdash;that of eating the mucus from the nostrils.
A&nbsp;similar practice was noticed in Greenland by Egede,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag572" id = "tag572" href = "#note572">572</a> who goes
on quaintly to say: “Thus they make good the old proverb, ‘What drips

<p>We had no opportunity of witnessing any meeting between these people
and strange Eskimo, so that it is impossible to tell whether they
practice any particular form of salutation on such occasions. We saw
nothing of the kind among themselves. White men are saluted with shouts
of “Nakurúk!” (good), and some Eskimo have learned to shake hands. They
no longer practice the common Eskimo salutation of rubbing noses, but
say that they once did. Sergt. Middleton Smith, of our party, informs me
that he once saw a couple of natives in Capt. Herendeen’s trading store
give an exhibition of the way this salutation was formerly
practiced.</p>

<p>This custom was perhaps falling into disuse as early as 1837, since
Thomas Simpson,<a class = "tag" name = "tag573" id = "tag573" href =
"#note573">573</a> in describing his reception at Point Barrow, says:
“We were not, however, either upon this or any other occasion, favored
with the kooniks or nose-rubbing salutations that have so annoyed other
travelers.” Mr. Elson, however, expressly states that the people,
probably Utkiavwĭñmiun, whom he met at Refuge Inlet eleven years before,
rubbed noses and cheeks with him<a class = "tag" name = "tag574" id =
"tag574" href = "#note574">574</a> and Maguire<a class = "tag" name =
"tag575" id = "tag575" href = "#note575">575</a> narrates how the head
of the party of visitors from Point Hope saluted him. He says: “He fixed
his forehead against mine and used it as a fulcrum to rub noses several
times.”</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "customs_healing" id = "customs_healing"
href = "#customs">Healing.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>As is the case with Eskimo generally, these people rely for curing
disease chiefly upon the efforts of certain persons who have the power
of exorcising the supernatural beings by whom the disease is caused.
A&nbsp;large number of men and, I&nbsp;believe, some women were supposed
to have this power and exercise it in cases of sickness, in some
instances, at least, upon the payment of a fee. These people correspond
closely to the angekut of the Greenlanders and Eastern Eskimo, and the
so-called “shamans” of southern Alaska, but, as far as we could see, do
not possess the power and influence usually elsewhere ascribed to this
class.</p>

<p>It was exceedingly difficult to obtain any definite information
concerning these people, and we only discovered casually that such and
such a person was a “doctor” by hearing that he had been employed in a
certain case of sickness, or to perform some ceremony of incantation. We
did not even succeed in learning the name of this class of people, who,
in talking with us, would call themselves “tûktĕ,” as they did our
surgeon. On one occasion some of the party happened to visit the house
of a sick man where one of these “doctors” was at work. He sat facing
the entrance of the house, beating his drum at intervals, and making a
babbling noise with his lips, followed by long speeches addressed to
something down the trapdoor, bidding it “go!” We were given to
understand that these speeches were addressed to a tuɐña or supernatural
being.<a class = "tag" name = "tag576" id = "tag576" href =
"#note576">576</a> Their only idea of direct treatment of disease is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page423" id = "page423">
423</a></span>
apparently to apply a counterirritant by scarification of the surface of
the part affected.</p>

<p>We know of one case where a sufferer from some liver complaint had
inflicted on himself, or had had inflicted upon him, quite a
considerable cut on the right side with a view of relieving the pain. We
also know of several cases where the patients had themselves cut on the
scalp or back to relieve headache or rheumatism, and one case where the
latter disorder, I&nbsp;believe, had been treated by a severe cut on the
side of the knee. A&nbsp;similar practice has been observed at Plover
Bay, Siberia, by Hooper,<a class = "tag" name = "tag577" id = "tag577"
href = "#note577">577</a> who also mentions the use of a kind of seton
for the relief of headache.</p>

<p>They also practice a sort of rough-and-ready surgery, as in the case
of the man already mentioned, whose feet had both been amputated. One of
the men who lost the tip of his forefinger by the explosion of a
cartridge was left with a stump of bone protruding at the end of the
finger. Our surgeon attempted to treat this, but after two unsuccessful
trials to etherize the patient he was obliged to give it up. When,
however, the young man’s father-in-law, who was a noted “doctor,” came
home he said at once that the stump must come off, and the patient had
to submit to the operation without ether. The “doctor” tried to borrow
Dr. Oldmixon’s bone forceps, and when these were refused him cut the
bone off, I&nbsp;believe, with a chisel. They appear to have no cure for
blindness. We heard nothing of the curious process of “couching”
described by Egede in Greenland, p.&nbsp;121. We had no opportunity of
observing their methods of treating wounds or other external injuries.
Sufferers were very glad to be treated by our surgeon, and eagerly
accepted his medicines, though he had considerable difficulty in making
them obey his directions about taking care of themselves.</p>

<p>After they had been in the habit of receiving the surgeon’s medicine
for some time, one of the Utkiavwĭñ natives gave Capt. Herendeen what he
said was their own medicine. It is a tiny bit of turf which they called
nuna kĭñmölq, and which, therefore, probably came from the highland of
the upper Meade River, which region bears the name of Kĭñmölq. We were
able to get very little information about this substance, but my
impression is that it was said to be administered internally, and I
believe was specially recommended for bleeding at the lungs. Possibly
this is the same as “the black moss that grows on the mountain,” which,
according to Crantz<a class = "tag" name = "tag578" id = "tag578" href =

blood-spitting.</p>

<p>From the fact that we did not hear of any of the deaths until after
their occurrence, we were able to learn very few of their
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page424" id = "page424">
424</a></span>
customs concerning the dead. The few observations we were able to make
agree in the main with those made elsewhere. For instance, we learned
with tolerable certainty that the relatives of the dead, at least, must
abstain from working on wood with an ax or hammer for a certain
period&mdash;I believe, four or five days. According to Dall,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag579" id = "tag579" href = "#note579">579</a> in the
region about Norton Sound the men can not cut wood with an ax for five
days after a death has occurred. In Greenland the household of the
deceased were obliged to abstain for a while from certain kinds of food
and work.<a class = "tag" name = "tag580" id = "tag580" href =
"#note580">580</a></p>

<p>A woman from Utkiavwĭñ, who came over to the station one day in the
autumn of 1881, declined to sew on clothing, even at our house, because,
as she told Lieut. Ray, there was a dead man in the village who had not
yet been carried out to the cemetery and “he would see her.” After
consulting with her husband, however, she concluded she could protect
herself from him by tracing a circle about her on the floor with a
snow-knife. In this circle she did the sewing required, and was careful
to keep all her work inside of it.</p>

<p>One of the natives informed me that when a man died his labrets were
taken out and thrown away. I&nbsp;remember, however, seeing a young man
wearing a plug labret of syenite, which he said had belonged to an old
man who died early in the winter of 1881-’82. It was perhaps removed
before he actually died.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "dead_disposing" id = "dead_disposing" href
= "#dead">Manner of disposing of the dead.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>The corpse is wrapped up in a piece of sailcloth (deerskin was
formerly used), laid upon a flat sled, and dragged out by a small party
of people&mdash;perhaps the immediate relatives of the deceased, though
we never happened to see one of these funeral processions except from a
distance&mdash;to the cemetery, the place where “they sleep on the
ground.” This place at Utkiavwĭñ is a rising ground about a mile and a
half east of the village, near the head of the southwest branch of the
Isûtkwa lagoon. At Nuwŭk the main cemetery is at “Nexeurá,” between the
village and Pernyû. The bodies are laid out upon the ground without any
regular arrangement apparently, though it is difficult to be sure of
this, as most of the remains have been broken up and scattered by dogs
and foxes. With a freshly wrapped body it is almost impossible to tell
which is the head and which the feet. We unfortunately never noticed
whether the heads were laid toward any particular point of the compass,
as has been observed in other localities. Dr. Simpson says that the head
is laid to the east at Point Barrow.</p>

<p>Various implements belonging to the deceased are broken and laid
beside the corpse, and the sled is sometimes broken and laid over it.
Sometimes, however, the latter is withdrawn a short distance from the
cemetery and left on the tundra for one moon, after which it is brought
back to the village. Most people do not seem to be troubled at having
the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page425" id = "page425">
425</a></span>
bodies of their relatives disturbed by the dogs or other animals,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag581" id = "tag581" href = "#note581">581</a>
but we know of one case where the parents of two children who died very
nearly at the same time, finding that the dogs were getting at the
bodies, raised them on stages of driftwood about 4 or 5 feet high.
Similar stages were observed by Hooper at Plover Bay;<a class = "tag"
name = "tag582" id = "tag582" href = "#note582">582</a> but this method
of disposing of the dead appears to have gone out of use at the present
day, since Dall<a class = "tag" name = "tag583" id = "tag583" href =
"#note583">583</a> describes the ordinary Siberian method of laying out
the dead in ovals of stone as in use at Plover Bay at the time of his
visit.</p>

<p>The cemetery at Utkiavwĭñ is not confined to the spot I have
mentioned, though most of the bodies are exposed there. A&nbsp;few
bodies are also exposed on the other side of the lagoon, and one body,
that of a man, was laid out at the edge of the higher tundra, about a
mile due east from the station. The body was covered with canvas, staked
down all round with broken paddles, and over it was laid a flat sledge
with one runner broken.<a class = "tag" name = "tag584" id = "tag584"
href = "#note584">584</a> At one end of the body lay a wooden dish, and
under the edge of the canvas were broken seal-darts and other spears.
The body lay in an east and west line, but we could not tell which end
was the head. All sorts of objects were scattered round the
cemetery&mdash;tools, dishes, and even a few guns&mdash;though we saw
none that appeared to have been serviceable when exposed, except one
Snider rifle. If, as is the case among Eskimo in a good many other
places, all the personal property of the deceased is supposed to become
unclean and must be exposed with him, it is probable that his friends
manage to remove the more valuable articles before he is actually
dead.<a class = "tag" name = "tag585" id = "tag585" href =
"#note585">585</a></p>

<p>The method of disposing of the dead varies slightly among the Eskimo
in different localities, but the weapons or other implements belonging
to the deceased are always laid beside the corpse. The custom at Smith
Sound, as described by Bessels,<a class = "tag" name = "tag586" id =
"tag586" href = "#note586">586</a> is remarkably like that at Point
Barrow. The corpse was wrapped in furs, placed on a sledge, and dragged
out and buried in the snow with the face to the west. The sledge was
laid over the body and the weapons of the deceased were deposited beside
it. Unlike the Point Barrow natives, however, they usually cover the
body with stones. In the same passage Dr. Bessels describes a peculiar
symbol of mourning, not employed, so far as I can learn, elsewhere. The
male mourners plugged up the right nostril with hay and the females the
left, and these plugs were worn for several days.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page426" id = "page426">

The custom of covering the body with stones appears to be universally
prevalent east of the Mackenzie region.<a class = "tag" name = "tag587"
id = "tag587" href = "#note587">587</a></p>

<p>The bodies seen by Dr. Richardson in the delta of the Mackenzie were
wrapped in skins and loosely covered with driftwood,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag588" id = "tag588" href = "#note588">588</a> and a similar
arrangement was noticed at Kotzebue Sound by Beechey, who figures<a
class = "tag" name = "tag589" id = "tag589" href = "#note589">589</a>
a&nbsp;sort of little wigwam of driftwood built over the dead man. At
Port Clarence Nordenskiöld<a class = "tag" name = "tag590" id = "tag590"
href = "#note590">590</a> saw two corpses “laid on the ground, fully
clothed, without protection of any coffin, but surrounded by a close
fence consisting of a number of tent-poles driven crosswise into the
ground. Alongside one of the corpses lay a <i>kayak</i> with oars,
a&nbsp;loaded double-barreled gun with locks at half-cock and caps on,
various other weapons, clothes, tinder-box, snowshoes, drinking-vessels,
two masks, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and strangely shaped animal figures.” On the
Siberian coast the dead are sometimes burned.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag591" id = "tag591" href = "#note591">591</a></p>

<p>Nordenskiöld believes that the coast Chukches have perhaps begun to
abandon the custom of burning the dead, but I am rather inclined to
think that is a custom of the “deermen,” which the people of the coast
of pure or mixed Eskimo blood never fully adopted. Dall, indeed, was
explicitly informed that the custom was only used with the bodies of
“good” men, and at the time of Nordenskiöld’s visit he found it “at
least certain that the people of Pitlekaj exclusively bury their dead by
laying them out on the tundra.” The body is surrounded by an oval of
stones, but apparently not covered with them as in the east.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag592" id = "tag592" href = "#note592">592</a> The Krause
brothers observed by the bodies, besides “die erwähnten Geräthschaften”
[Lanzen, Bogen und Pfeile für die Männer, Koch- und Hausgeräthe für die
Weiber], “unter einen kleinen Steinhaufen ein Hunde-, Renthier-, Bären-
oder Walross-Schädel.” This custom shows a curious resemblance to that
described by Egede<a class = "tag" name = "tag593" id = "tag593" href =
"#note593">593</a> in Greenland: “When little Children die and are
buried, they put the Head of a Dog near the Grave, fancying that
Children, having no Understanding, they can not
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page427" id = "page427">
427</a></span>
by themselves find the Way, but the Dog must guide them to the Land of
the Souls.” The body is usually laid out at full length upon the ground.
Among the ancient Greenlanders,<a class = "tag" name = "tag594" id =
"tag594" href = "#note594">594</a> however, and in the Yukon region the
body was doubled up. In the latter region the body was laid on its side
in a box of planks four feet long and raised on four supports<a class =
"tag" name = "tag595" id = "tag595" href = "#note595">595</a> or wrapped
up in mats and covered with rocks or driftwood.<a class = "tag" name =

the dead in a short coffin, to judge from the figures given by the

report, appears also to prevail at the mouth of the Kuskokwim. In the
island of Kadiak, according to Dall and Lisiansky,<a class = "tag" name

<p>I can hardly do better than quote Dr. Simpson’s words, already
referred to (op.&nbsp;cit. page 252), on this subject: “A&nbsp;man seems
to have unlimited authority in his own hut.” Nevertheless, his rule
seems to be founded on respect and mutual agreement, rather than on
despotic authority. The wife appears to be consulted, as already stated,
on all important occasions, and, to quote Dr. Simpson again (ibid.):
“Seniority gives precedence when there are several women in one hut, and
the sway of the elder in the direction of everything connected with her
duties seems never disputed.” When more than one family inhabit the same
house the head of each family appears to have authority over his own
relatives, while the relations between the two are governed solely by
mutual agreement.</p>

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "government_village" id =

<p>These people have no established form of government nor any chiefs in
the ordinary sense of the word, but appear to be ruled by a strong
public opinion, combined with a certain amount of respect for the
opinions of the elder people, both men and women, and by a large number
of traditional observances like those concerning the whale fishery, the
deceased, etc., already described. In the ordinary relations of life a
person, as a rule, avoids doing anything to his neighbor which he would
not wish to have done to himself, and affairs which concern the
community as a whole, as for instance their relations with us at the
station, are settled by a general and apparently informal discussion,
when the opinion of the majority carries the day. The majority appears
to have no means, short of individual violence, of enforcing obedience
to its decisions, but, as far as we could see, the matter is left to the
good sense of the parties concerned. Respect for the opinions of elders
is so great that the people may be said to be practically under what is
called “simple elder rule.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag598" id =
"tag598" href = "#note598">598</a> Public opinion has
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page428" id = "page428">
428</a></span>
formulated certain rules in regard to some kinds of property and the
division of game, which are remarkably like those noticed among Eskimo
elsewhere, and which may be supposed to have grown up among the
ancestors of the Eskimo, before their separation.</p>

<p>For instance, in Greenland,<a class = "tag" name = "tag599" id =
"tag599" href = "#note599">599</a> “Anyone picking up pieces of
driftwood or goods lost at sea or on land was considered the rightful
owner of them; and to make good his possession he had only to carry them
up above high-water mark and put stones upon them, no matter where his
homestead might be.” Now, at Point Barrow we often saw the natives
dragging driftwood up to the high-water mark, and the owner seemed
perfectly able to prove his claim. Lieut. Ray informs me that he has
seen men mark such sticks of timber by cutting them with their adzes and
that sticks so marked were respected by the other natives. On one
occasion, when he was about to have a large piece of drift-timber
dragged up to the station, a&nbsp;woman came up and proved that the
timber belonged to her by pointing out the freshly cut mark. I&nbsp;have
myself seen a native claim a barrel which had been washed ashore, by
setting it up on end.</p>

<p>As far as we could learn, the smaller animals, as for instance,
birds, the smaller seals, reindeer, etc., are the property of the
hunter, instead of being divided as in some other localities, for
example at Smith <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has , for.">Sound,<a class = "tag" name = "tag600" id = "tag600" href =
"#note600">600</a>.</ins> The larger seals and walruses appeared to be
divided among the boat’s crew, the owner of the boat apparently keeping
the tusks of the walrus and perhaps the skin. A&nbsp;bear, however, both
flesh and skin, is equally divided among all who in any way had a hand
in the killing. We learned this with certainty from having to purchase
the skin of a bear killed at the village, where a number of men had been
engaged in the hunt. When a whale is taken, as I have already said, the
whalebone is equally divided among the crews of all the boats in sight
at the time of killing. All comers, however, have a right to all the
flesh, blubber, and blackskin that they can cut off.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag601" id = "tag601" href = "#note601">601</a></p>

<p>Dr. Rink, in describing the social order of the ancient
Greenlanders,<a class = "tag" name = "tag602" id = "tag602" href =
"#note602">602</a> says: “Looking at what has been said regarding the
rights of property and the division of the people into certain
communities, in connection with the division of property into the
classes just given, we are led to the conclusion that the right of any
individual to hold more than a certain amount of property was, if not
regulated by law, at least jealously watched by the rest of the
community, and that virtually
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page429" id = "page429">
429</a></span>
the surplus of any individual or community, fixed by the arbitrary rate
which tradition or custom had assigned, was made over to those who had
less.” At Point Barrow, however, the idea of individual ownership
appears to be much more strongly developed. As far as we could learn,
there is no limit to the amount of property which an individual, at
least the head of a family, may accumulate. Even though the whalebone
be, as already described, divided among all the boats’ crews “in at the
death,” no objection is made to one man buying it all up, if he has the
means, for his own private use.</p>

<p>This has given rise to a regular wealthy and aristocratic class, who,
however, are not yet sufficiently differentiated from the poorer people
to refuse to associate on any terms but those of social equality. The
men of this class are the umialiks, a&nbsp;word which appears in many
corrupted forms on the coast of Western America and is often supposed to
mean “chief.” Dr. Simpson<a class = "tag" name = "tag603" id = "tag603"
href = "#note603">603</a> says: “The chief men are called O-mé-liks
(wealthy),” but “wealthy” is an explanation of the position of these
men, and not a translation of the title, which, as we obtained it, is
precisely the same as the Greenland word for <i>owner of a boat</i>,
umialik (from umia(<i>k</i>), and the termination lĭk or lĭ-ñ.&nbsp;This
is one of the few cases in which the final <i>k</i> is sounded at Point
Barrow as in Greenland).</p>

<p>Dr. Rink has already observed<a class = "tag" name = "tag604" id =
"tag604" href = "#note604">604</a> that the word used by Simpson “no
doubt must be the same as the Greenlandish umialik, signifying owner of
a boat,” and as I heard the title more than once carefully pronounced at
Point Barrow it was the identical word. The umialiks, as Simpson says,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag605" id = "tag605" href = "#note605">605</a>
“have acquired their position by being more thrifty and intelligent,
better traders, and usually better hunters, as well as physically
stronger and more daring.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag606" id = "tag606"
href = "#note606">606</a> They have acquired a certain amount of
influence and respect from these reasons, as well as from their wealth,
which enables them to purchase the services of others to man their
boats, but appear to have absolutely no authority outside of their own
families.<a class = "tag" name = "tag607" id = "tag607" href =
"#note607">607</a> Petroff<a class = "tag" name = "tag608" id = "tag608"
href = "#note608">608</a> considers them as a sort of “middlemen or
spokesmen,” who make themselves “prominent by superintending all
intercourse and traffic with visitors.”</p>

<p>This sort of prominence, however, appears to have been conferred upon
them by the traders, who, ignorant of the very democratic state of
Eskimo society, naturally look for “chiefs” to deal with. They pick out
the best looking and best dressed man in the village and endeavor to win
his favor by giving him presents, receiving him into the cabin, and
conducting all their dealings with the natives through him. The chief,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page430" id = "page430">
430</a></span>
thus selected, is generally shrewd enough to make the most of the
greatness thrust upon him, and no doubt often pretends to more influence
and power than he actually possesses.<a class = "tag" name = "tag609" id
= "tag609" href = "#note609">609</a></p>

<p>As to the story of the whalemen, that the “chieftainship” is the
reward of the best fighter, who holds it like a “challenge cup,” subject
to being called out at any time to defend his rank in a duel, as far as
concerns Point Barrow, this is a sheer fable, perhaps invented by the
Eskimo to impose upon the strangers, but more likely the result of
misunderstanding and a vivid imagination on the part of the whites.
Among umialiks, one or two appear to have more wealth and influence than
the rest. Tcuñaura in Utkiavwĭñ and the late Katiga at Nuwŭk were said,
according to Captain Herendeen, to be “great umialiks” and Tcuñaura was
always spoken of as the foremost man in Utkiavwĭñ. We knew of one party
coming up from Sidaru with presents for Tcuñaura, and were informed that
the other Eskimo never sold to him, but only gave him presents. It was
also said that Katiga’s infant son would one day be a “great
umialik.”</p>

<p>All these men are or have been captains of whaling umiaks, and the
title umialiks appears to be applied to them in this capacity, since
many of the poorer men, who, as far as we could learn, were not
considered umialiks, own umiaks which they do not fit out for whaling,
but use only to transport their families from place to place in the
summer.</p>


<h4><a name = "religion" id = "religion" href =

<h6 class = "ital"><a name = "religion_general" id = "religion_general"
href = "#religion">General ideas.</a>&mdash;</h6>

<p>It was exceedingly difficult to get any idea of the religious belief
of the people, partly from our inability to make ourselves understood in
regard to abstract ideas and partly from ignorance on our part of the
proper method of conducting such inquiries. For instance, in trying to
get at their ideas of a future life, we could only ask “Where does a man
go when he dies?” to which we, of course, received the obvious answer,
“To the cemetery!” Moreover, such a multitude of other and easier lines
of investigation presented themselves for our attention that we were
naturally inclined to neglect the difficult field of religion, and
besides under the circumstances of our intercourse it was almost
impossible to get the attention of the natives when their minds were not
full of other subjects.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many of the fragments of superstition and tradition
that we were able to collect agree remarkably with what has been
observed among the Eskimo elsewhere, so that it is highly probable that
their religion is of the same general character as that of the
Greenlanders, namely, a&nbsp;belief in a multitude of supernatural
beings, who are to be exorcised or propitiated by various observances,
especially by the performances of certain specially gifted people, who
are something of the nature of wizards. So much has been written by many
authors
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page431" id = "page431">
431</a></span>
about these wizards or “doctors,” the angekut of the eastern Eskimo, the
so-called “shamans” of Alaska and Siberia, that I need make no special
reference to their writings except where they happen to throw light on
our own observations. Dr. Simpson succeeded in obtaining more
information concerning the religious belief of these people than our
party was able to do, and his observations,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag610" id = "tag610" href = "#note610">610</a> to which ours are in
some degree supplementary, tend to corroborate the conclusion at which I
have arrived.</p>

<p>Our information in regard to the special class of wizards was rather
vague. We learned that many men in the village, distinguishable from the
rest by no visible characteristics, were able to heal the sick, procure
good weather, favorable winds, plenty of game, and do other things by
“talking” and beating the drum. We did not learn the number of these men
in either village, but we heard of very many different men doing one or
the other of these things, while others of our acquaintance never
attempted them. Neither did we learn that any one of these men was
considered superior to the rest, as appears to be the case in some
regions, nor how a man could attain this power. Some of these men, who
appeared to give particular attention to curing the sick, called
themselves “tû´ktĕ” (“doctor”), but, probably for want of properly
directed inquiries, we did not learn the Eskimo name of these people. We
were definitely informed, however, that their “talk,” when treating
disease or trying to obtain fair weather, etc., was addressed to
“tu´ɐña,” or a supernatural being. This name, of course, differs only in
dialectic form from that applied in other places to the universal
familiar spirits of Eskimo superstition.</p>

<p>We at first supposed that “tuɐña” meant some particular individual
demon, but Dr. Simpson is probably right in saying that the Point Barrow
natives, like the rest of the Eskimo, recognize a host of tuɐñain, since
“tuɐña” was described to us under a variety of forms. Most of the
natives whom we asked if they had seen tuɐña, said that they had not,
but that other men, mentioning certain “doctors,” had seen him. One man,
however, said that he had seen tuɐña in the kûdyĭgĭ, when the people
“talked” sitting in the dark, with their heads bowed and faces covered,
and tuɐña came with a noise like a great bird.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag611" id = "tag611" href = "#note611">611</a> He had raised his head
and saw tuɐña, like a man with bloodless cheeks.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag612" id = "tag612" href = "#note612">612</a> Tuɐña again was called
“a&nbsp;bad man, dead” (apparently
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page432" id = "page432">
432</a></span>
a ghost), sometimes as large as a man and sometimes dwarfish, sometimes
a fleshless skeleton, while one man, to describe him, made the same
grimace that a white man would use to indicate a hobgoblin, with staring
eyes, gaping mouth, and hands outstretched like claws. Apparently
“tuɐña” in conversation with us was used to designate all the various
supernatural objects of their belief, ghosts as well as familiar
spirits. For instance, in Greenland, according to Rink,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag613" id = "tag613" href = "#note613">613</a> a&nbsp;ghost
“manifests himself by whistling or singing in the ears.” Now, Lieut. Ray
was walking rapidly one day in the winter with an Eskimo and his wife,
and the woman suddenly stopped and said she “heard tuɐña”&mdash;that he
made a noise like <i>singing in the ears</i>.</p>

<p>The people generally have a great dread of “tuɐña,” who they say
would kill them, and are very averse to going out alone in the dark. One
of each party that came over from the village in the evening usually
carried a drawn knife, preferably one of the large double-edged knives,
supposed to be Siberian and already described, in his hand as defense
against tuɐña, and a drawn knife was sometimes even carried in the
daylight “nanumunlu tuɐñamunlu,” “for bear and demon.” Notwithstanding
their apparently genuine dread of “tuɐña,” they are by no means averse
to talking or even joking about him.</p>

<p>The knife also serves as a protection against the aurora, which most
of them agree is bad, and when bright likely to kill a person by
striking him in the back of the neck. However, brandishing the knife at
it will keep it off. Besides, as a woman told me one night, you can
drive off a “bad” aurora by throwing at it dog’s excrement and urine.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag614" id = "tag614" href =
"#note614">614</a></p>

<p>Lieut. Ray saw in one of the houses in Utkaiwiñ, a contrivance for
frightening away a “tuɐña” from the entrance to a house should he try to
get in. The man had hung in the trapdoor the handle of a seal-drag by
means of a thong spiked to the wall with a large knife, and told Lieut.
Ray that if “tuɐña” tried to get into the house he would undoubtedly
catch hold of the handle to help himself up, which would pull down the
knife upon his head and frighten him off. We never had an opportunity of
witnessing the ceremony of summoning “tuɐña,” nor did we ever hear of
the ceremony taking place during our stay at the station, but we were
fortunate enough to observe several other performances, though they do
not appear to be frequent. The ceremony of healing the sick and the
ceremonies connected with the whale-fishery have already been
described.</p>

<p>On the 21st of February, 1883, Lieut. Ray and Capt. Herendeen
happened to be at the village on time to see the tuɐña, who had been
causing the bad weather, expelled from the village. Some of the natives
said the next day that they had <i>killed</i> the tuɐña, but they said
at the same time he had gone “a&nbsp;long way off.” When Lieut. Ray
reached
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page433" id = "page433">
433</a></span>
the village, women were standing at the doors of the houses armed with
snow-knives and clubs with which they made passes over the entrance when
the people inside called out. He entered one house and found a woman
vigorously driving the tuɐña out of every corner with a knife. They then
repaired to the kûdyĭgi, where there were ten or twelve people, each of
whom, to quote from Lieut. Ray’s note book, “made a charge against the
evil spirit, telling what injuries they had received from it.” Then they
went into the open air, where a fire had been built in front of the
entrance, and formed a half circle around the fire. Each then went up
and made a speech, bending over the fire (according to Simpson, who
describes a similar ceremony at Nuwŭk on p.&nbsp;274 of his paper,
coaxing the tuɐña to come under the fire to warm himself). Then they
brought out a large tub full of urine, to which, Simpson says, each man
present had contributed, and held it ready near the fire, while two men
stood with their rifles in readiness, and a boy stood near the fire with
a large stone in his hands, bracing himself firmly with his feet spread
apart for a vigorous throw. Then they chanted as follows (the words of
this chant were obtained afterward by the writer):</p>

<div class = "song">
<p>Tâk tâk tâk tohâ!</p>
<p>Nìju´a hâ!</p>
<p>He! he! he!</p>
<p>Haiyahe!</p>
<p>Yaiyahe!</p>
<p>Hwi!</p>
</div>

<p>And instantly the contents of the tub were dashed on the fire, the
stone thrown into the embers, and both men discharged their rifles, one
into the embers, and one into the cloud of steam as it rose. Then all
brushed their clothes violently and shouted, and the tuɐña was killed.
By a fortunate coincidence, the next day was the finest we had had for a
long time.</p>

<p>Sacrifices are also occasionally made to these supernatural beings as
in Greenland “gifts were offered to the inue of certain rocks, capes and
ice firths, principally when traveling and passing those places.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tag615" id = "tag615" href =
"#note615">615</a></p>

<p>Capt. Herendeen, in the fall of 1882, went to the rivers in company
with one of the “doctors.” When they arrived at the river Kuaru, where
the latter intended to stay for the fishing, he got out his drum and
“talked” for a long time, and breaking off very small pieces of tobacco
threw them into the air, crying out, “Tuɐña, tuɐña, I&nbsp;give you
tobacco! give me plenty of fish.” When they passed the dead men at the
cemetery, he gave them tobacco in the same way, asking them also for
fish.<a class = "tag" name = "tag616" id = "tag616" href =
"#note616">616</a> We noticed but few other superstitious observances
which have not been already described. As in Greenland and elsewhere,
superstition requires certain persons to abstain from certain kinds of
food. For instance, Mûñialu, and apparently many others, were not
permitted
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page434" id = "page434">
434</a></span>
to eat the burbot, another man was denied ptarmigan, and a woman<a class
= "tag" name = "tag617" id = "tag617" href = "#note617">617</a> at Nuwŭk
was not allowed to eat “earth food,” that is, anything which grew upon
the ground. Lieut. Ray also mentions a man who was forbidden bear’s
flesh.<a class = "tag" name = "tag618" id = "tag618" href =
"#note618">618</a></p>

<p>We observed some traces of the superstition concerning the heads of
seals and other marine animals taken in the chase, which has been
noticed elsewhere. Crantz says:<a class = "tag" name = "tag619" id =
"tag619" href = "#note619">619</a> “The heads of seals must not be
fractured, nor must they be thrown into the sea, but be piled in a heap
before the door,<a class = "tag" name = "tag620" id = "tag620" href =
"#note620">620</a> that the souls of the seals may not be enraged and
scare their brethren from the coast.” And Capt. Parry found that at
Winter Island they carefully preserved the heads of all the animals
killed during the winter, except two or three of the walrus which he
obtained with great difficulty. The natives told him that they were to
be thrown into the sea in the summer, but at Iglulik they readily sold
them before the summer arrived.<a class = "tag" name = "tag621" id =
"tag621" href = "#note621">621</a></p>

<p>I tried very hard to get a full series of skulls from the seals taken
at Utkiavwĭñ in the winter of 1882-’83, but though I frequently asked
the natives to bring them over for sale, they never did so, till at last
one young woman promised to bring me all I wanted at the price of half a
pound of gunpowder a skull. Nevertheless, she brought over only two or
three at that price. We did not observe what was done with the skulls,
but frequently observed quantities of the smaller bones of the seals
carefully tucked away in the crevices of the ice at some distance from
the shore. We had comparatively little difficulty in obtaining skulls of
the walrus, but I observed that the bottom of Tûseráru, the little pond
at the edge of the village, was covered with old walrus skulls, as if
they had been deposited there for years. The superstition appears to be
in full force among the Chukches, who live near the place where the
<i>Vega</i> wintered. <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads‘Nordenskjöld’">Nordenskiöld</ins> was unable to purchase a pair of

<p>Like the Greenlanders<a class = "tag" name = "tag624" id = "tag624"
href = "#note624">624</a> and other Eskimos, they place great reliance
on amulets or talismans, which are carried on the person, in the boat,
or even inserted in weapons, each apparently with some
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page435" id = "page435">
435</a></span>
specific purpose, which indeed we learned in the case of some of those
in the collection. Like the amulets of the Greenlanders, they appear to
be<a class = "tag" name = "tag625" id = "tag625" href =
"#note625">625</a> “certain animals or things which had belonged to or
been in contact with certain persons (e.g., the people of ancient times,
or fortunate hunters) or supernatural beings,” and “objects which merely
by their appearance recalled the effect expected from the amulet, such
as figures of various objects.” To the latter class belong the rudely
flaked flint images of whales, already mentioned, and probably many of
the other small images of men and animals already described, especially
those fitted with holes for strings to hang them up by.</p>

</div>

<p>The flint whale is a very common amulet, intended, as we understood,
to give good luck, in whaling, and is worn habitually by many of the men
and boys under the clothes, suspended around the neck by a string. The
captain and harpooner of a whaling crew also wear them as pendants on
the fillets already described, and on the breast of the jacket. We
obtained five of these objects, all of very nearly the same shape, but
of different materials and varying somewhat in size. Fig. 421 represents
one of these (No.&nbsp;56703 [208] from Utkiavwĭñ) made of a piece of
hard colorless glass, probably a fragment of a ship’s “deadlight.” It is
rather roughly flaked into a figure of a “bowhead” whale, 3.4 inches
long, as seen from above and very much flattened with exaggerated
flukes. The flippers were rudely indicated in the outline, but the left
one is broken off.</p>

<p>No. 89613 [771] from Utkiavwĭñ is a very similar image, 2.4 inches
long, which perhaps is of the same material, though it may be made of
rock crystal. No. 56707 [159] from Utkiavwĭñ is a very small whale (1.4
inches long), chipped in large flakes out of a water-worn pebble of
smoky quartz, while No. 89577 [939] Fig. 422, from the same village,
which is a trifle larger (2&nbsp;inches long), is made of dark crimson
jasper. The large black flint whale, No. 56683 [61], also from
Utkiavwĭñ, which is 3.9 inches long, is the rudest of all the figures of
the whales. It is precisely the shape of the blade of a skin scraper,
except for the roughly indicated flukes.</p>

<p>Fig. 423 (No. 89524 [1299] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a rude wooden image of
the same animal, 3½ inches long, very broad and flat-bellied. It is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page436" id = "page436">
436</a></span>
smoothly carved and has a fragment of sky-blue glass inlaid to represent
the left eye and a bit of iron pyrites for the right. The flukes have
been split wholly off and fastened on with a lashing of narrow whalebone
passing through a vertical hole in the “small” and round the edge of the
flukes. The flukes themselves have been split across and appear to have
been doweled together. This shows that the owner attached considerable
value to the object, or he would not have taken the trouble to mend it
when another could have been so easily whittled out. In the middle of
the belly is an oblong cavity, containing something which probably adds
greater power to the charm. What this is can not be seen, as a band of
sealskin with the hair shaved off has been shrunk on round the hinder
half of the body and secured by a seam on the right side. A&nbsp;double
turn of sinew braid is knotted round the middle of the body, leaving two
ends which are tied together in a loop, showing that this object was
meant to be attached somewhere about the person.</p>

<p>To this class also probably belong the skins or pieces of animals
worn as amulets, probably with a view of obtaining the powers of the
particular animal, as in so many cases in the stories related in Rink’s
Tales and Traditions. We frequently saw men wearing at the belt bunches
of the claws of the bear or wolverine, or the metacarpal bones of the
wolf.<a class = "tag" name = "tag626" id = "tag626" href =
"#note626">626</a> The head or beak of the gull or raven<a class = "tag"

personal amulet, and one man wore a small dried flounder.<a class =

<p>We collected a number of these animal amulets to be worn on the
person, but only succeeded in learning the special purpose of one of
them, No. 89532 [1307], from Utkiavwĭñ, which was said to be intended to
give good luck in deer hunting. It is a young unbranched antler of a
reindeer, 6&nbsp;inches long, and apparently separated from the skull at
the “bur,” with the “velvet” skin still adhering, though most of the
hair is worn off except at the tip. A&nbsp;bit of sinew is tied round
the base.</p>

<p>No. 89522 [1573], from Utkiavwĭñ, is an amulet consisting of the last
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page437" id = "page437">
437</a></span>
three joints of the foot of a reindeer fawn, with the skin and hoof and
about 1½ inches of tendon attached behind, through a hole in the end of
which is knotted about 3 inches of seal thong. No. 89525 [1314] from the
same village, is a precisely similar charm. No. 89699 [779] from <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Utkavwĭñ’">Utkiavwĭñ</ins>, is
the subfossil incisor tooth of some ruminant with a hole drilled through
the root for a string to hang it up by. It was said to be the tooth of
the “ug’ru´nû,” a&nbsp;large animal, long extinct. As the natives said,
“Here on the land are none, only the bones remain.” No. 89743 [1110],
from Utkiavwĭñ, is a molar tooth of the same animal, probably, weathered
and old, with a hole freshly drilled through one root and a long piece
of sinew braid with the ends knotted together looped into it. There are
also in the collection two very old teeth which probably were inclosed
in little sacks of skin and worn as amulets.</p>

<p>No. 89698 [1580], from Utkiavwĭñ, is the tusk of a very young walrus,
only 2½ inches long, and No. 89452 [1148] from Utkiavwĭñ, is the canine
tooth of a polar bear. No. 56547 [656], from the same village, is a
similar tooth.<a class = "tag" name = "tag629" id = "tag629" href =
"#note629">629</a></p>

<p>The only amulet attached to a weapon, which we collected, is the
tern’s bill, already alluded to, placed under the whalebone lashing on
the seal-spear, No. 89910 [1694]. Perhaps the idea of this charm is that
the spear should plunge down upon the seal with as sure an aim as the
tern does upon its prey.<a class = "tag" name = "tag630" id = "tag630"
href = "#note630">630</a></p>

<p>A number of amulets of this class are always carried in the
whaling-umiak. I&nbsp;have already mentioned the wolf-skulls, stuffed
ravens and eagles, fox-tails<a class = "tag" name = "tag631" id =
"tag631" href = "#note631">631</a> and bunches of feathers used for this
purpose. Most of these charms are parts of some rapacious animal or
bird, but parts of other animals seem to have some virtue on these
occasions.</p>

<p>For instance, I noticed the axis vertebra of a seal in one
whaling-umiak, and we collected a rudely stuffed skin of a godwit
(Limosa lapponica baueri), which, we were informed, was “for whales.”
This specimen (No.&nbsp;89526 [1328], Fig. 424, from Utkiavwĭñ) is
soiled and ragged, and has a stick thrust through the neck to hold it
out. The neck is wrapped around with a narrow strip of whalebone and
some coarse thread, part of which serves to lash on a slip of wood,
apparently to splice the stick inside. A&nbsp;bit of white man’s string
is passed around the body and tied in a loop to hang it up by. This
charm is perhaps to keep the boat from capsizing, since Crantz says that
the Greenlanders “like to fasten to their kajak a model of it
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* or only a dead
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page438" id = "page438">
438</a></span>
sparrow or snipe, or a bit of wood, stone, some feathers or hair, that
they may not overset” (vol. 1, p.&nbsp;216), and perhaps the bone of a
marine animal, like the seal, is to protect the crew from drowning
should the boat upset, after all.</p>

<p>No. 89529 [1150] from Utkiavwĭñ is a bunch of feathers to be carried
in the boat. It consists of nine wing feathers of the golden eagle, four
tied in a bunch with a bit of sinew round the quills, four tied up with
one end of the short bit of seal thong which serves to tie the whole
bundle together, one of which has all the light-colored parts of the
feather stained with red ocher, and a single feather shaft carefully

stuffed godwit.</p>

<p>No. 89527-8 [1327] from Utkiavwĭñ is the charm which will secure good
success in deerhunting if it is hung up outside of the snow house in
which the family is encamped. It consists of two roughly stuffed skins
of the black bellied plover (Charadrius squatarola), each with a stick
run through the body so that one end supports the neck and the other the
tail, and the necks wound with sinew. One has no head. A&nbsp;string of
sinew braid is tied around the body of each, so as to leave a free end
at the back, to which is fastened a little cross piece of bone, by which
it may be secured to a becket. Like the rest of the amulets in the
collection this has evidently seen service, being very old, worn, and
faded.</p>

<p>The other class of amulets, namely objects which have belonged to or
been in contact with certain persons or supernatural beings, or I may
add apparently certain localities, is represented by a number of
specimens. To the custom of using such things as amulets, we undoubtedly
owe the preservation of most of the ancient weapons and other
implements, especially those made of wood, bone, or other perishable
substances, like the ancient harpoon heads already described, one of
which, No. 89544 [1419], is still attached to the belt on which it was
worn.</p>

jade adzes 5.1 inches, slung with thong and whalebone, making a becket
by which it can be hung up. We did not learn the history of this amulet,
which at the time of collecting it was supposed to be a net sinker.
There would, however, be no reason for using so valuable an object for
such a purpose, when a common beach pebble would do just as well, unless
it was intended as a charm to insure success in fishing. It may even
have been carried as a charm on the person, since we afterwards saw a
still more bulky object used for such a purpose.</p>

<p>Such an object seems rather heavy to be carried on the person, but a
well known man in Utkiavwĭñ always carried with him when he went sealing
a large pear-shaped stone, which must have weighed upwards of two
pounds, suspended somewhere about his person. It is not unlikely that
this stone acquired its virtue as an amulet from having been a sinker
used by some lucky fisherman in former time or in a distant country. Mr.
H.&nbsp;W. Henshaw has already referred to the resemblance of this
amulet to the plummet-like “medicine stones” of some of our Indians.<a

<p>Fig. 426, (No. 89534 [1306] from Utkiavwĭñ) is an amulet for success
in whaling. It consists of three little irregular water-worn fragments
of amber carefully wrapped in a bit of parchment and inclosed in a
little wooden box 1½ inches long, made of two semicylindrical bits of
cottonwood, with the flat faces hollowed out and put together and
fastened up by three turns of sinew braid round the middle, tied in a
loose knot. The box is old and brown from age and handling. We heard of
other pieces of amber and earth (“nuna”) worn as amulets, wrapped up in
bits of leather and hung on the belt.</p>

<p>No. 89533 [1247], from Utkiavwĭñ, is simply a nearly square pebble,
1.4 inches long, of dark red jasper, slung in a bit of sinew braid so
that it can be hung on the belt. Fig. 427 (No.&nbsp;89525 [1308] from
Utkiavwĭñ) is some small object, placed in the center of the grain side
of a square bit of white sealskin, the edges of which are folded up
around it and tied tightly round with deer sinew, so as to make a little
round knob. I&nbsp;collected this amulet, and was particularly informed
how it was to be used. If it be fastened on the right shoulder it will
insure success in taking ducks with the “bolas.” Fig. 428
(No.&nbsp;89535 [1244] from Utkiavwĭñ) is an amulet whose history we did
not learn. It is a little oblong box 3.3 inches long, carved from a
block of cottonwood, with a flat cover tied on with nine turns of sinew
braid, and contains twenty-one dried humble-bees, which it was said came
from the river Kulugrua.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page440" id = "page440">

The natives have a great dread, apparently superstitious, of these bees
and the large gadflies (Œstens tarandi), one of which I have seen
scatter half a dozen people. A&nbsp;man one day caught one of these, and
whittled out a little box of wood, in which he shut the insect up and
tied it up with a shred of sinew, telling Capt. Herendeen that it was
“tuɐñamun,” for “tuɐña.”</p>

<p>A small lump of indurated gravel (No. 56725) [273] was one day
brought over from Utkiavwĭñ, with the story that it was a “medicine” for
driving away the ice. The man who uses this charm stands on the high
bank at the village, and breaking off grains of the gravel throws them
seaward. This will cause the ice to move off from the shore.</p>

<p>The essential identity of the amulets of the Point Barrow natives
with those used by the Eskimo elsewhere is shown by the following
passages from other writers. Egede says:<a class = "tag" name = "tag633"
id = "tag633" href = "#note633">633</a></p>

<blockquote>
A Superstition very common among them is to load themselves with Amulets
or Pomanders, dangling about their Necks and Arms, which consist in some
Pieces of old Wood, Stones or Bones, Bills and Claws of Birds, or
Anything else which their Fancy suggests to them.</blockquote>

<p>Crantz says:<a class = "tag" name = "tag634" id = "tag634" href =
"#note634">634</a></p>

<blockquote>
They are so different in the amulets or charms they hang on people, that
one laughs at another’s. These powerful preventives consist in a bit of
old wood hung around their necks, or a stone, or a bone, or a beak or
claw of a bird, or else a leather strap tied round their forehead,
breast, or arm.</blockquote>

<p>Parry speaks<a class = "tag" name = "tag635" id = "tag635" href =
"#note635">635</a> of what he supposes were amulets at Iglulik,
consisting of teeth of the fox, wolf, and musk-ox, bones of the
“kablĕĕarioo” (supposed to be the wolverine), and foxes’ noses. Kumlien
says<a class = "tag" name = "tag636" id = "tag636" href =
"#note636">636</a> that at Cumberland Gulf, “among the many
superstitious notions, the wearing of charms about the person is one of
the most curious. These are called <i>angoouk</i> or <i>amusit</i>, and
may be nothing but pieces of bone or wood, birds’ bills or claws, or an
animal’s teeth or skin.” A&nbsp;little girl “had a small envelope of
sealskin that was worn on the back of her inside jacket” containing two
small stones.</p>

<p>Such little pockets of skin sewed to the inner jacket are very common
at Point Barrow, but we did not succeed in any case in learning their
contents. At Kotzebue Sound, Beechey saw ravens’ skins on which the
natives set a high value, while the beaks and claws of these birds were
attached to their belts and headbands.<a class = "tag" name = "tag637"

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page441" id = "page441">

not likely that the use of these is confined to the women, as his words,

We had no special opportunities for watching the natives at work
netting, as but few nets happened to be made at the village during our
stay. It was, however, observed that the mesh stick was taken out every
time a knot was tied. Since my return, after a careful study of the
different mesh sticks in our collection, I&nbsp;have convinced myself by
experiment that the above method of using the tool is the only one which

It is a curious fact, however, that the narrowest kaiak paddles I have

There is quite a discrepancy in regard to this between Capt. Lyon’s
description referred to above and the two plates drawn by him in Parry’s

Dr. Kane’s description, though the best that we have of the
flat-bottomed Greenland kaiak and accompanied by diagrams, is
unfortunately vague in some important respects. It is in brief as
follows: “The skeleton consists of three longitudinal strips of wood on
each side *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* stretching from end to end. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
The upper of these, the gunwale *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* is somewhat stouter than
the others. The bottom is framed by three similar longitudinal strips.
These are crossed by other strips or hoops, which perform the office of
knees and ribs. They are placed at a distance of not more than 8 to 10
inches from one another. Wherever the parts of this framework meet or
cross they are bound together with reindeer tendon very artistically.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The <i>pah</i> or manhole *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* has a rim or
lip secured upon the gunwale and rising a couple of inches above the
deck.” (First Grinnell Exp., p.&nbsp;477.) It will be seen that he does
not mention any deck beams, which would be very necessary to keep the
gunwales spread apart. They are shown, however, on Crantz’s crude
section of a kaiak frame. (History of Greenland, vol. 1, pl. vii), and
are evidently mortised into the gunwale, as at Point Barrow. Crantz also
(op.&nbsp;cit., p.&nbsp;150) speaks of the use of whalebone for
fastening the frame together.</p>

<p class = "continue">Capt. Lyon’s description of the round-bottomed
kaiak used at Fury and Hecla Straits (Journal, p.&nbsp;233) is much more
explicit. He describes the frame as consisting of a gunwale on each side
4 or 5 inches wide in the middle and three-fourths inch thick, tapering
at each end, sixty-four hoop-shaped ribs (on&nbsp;a canoe 25 feet long),
seven slight rods outside of the ribs, twenty-two deck-beams, and a
batten running fore and aft, and a hoop round the cockpit. These large
kaiaks weigh 50 or 60 pounds. There is a very good figure of the Point
Barrow kaiak, paddled with a single paddle, in Smyth’s view of Nuwŭk
(Beechey’s Voyage, pl. opposite p.&nbsp;307).</p>

These passages being, as far as I know, the earliest description of the
umiak and kaiak are worth quotation: “Their boats are made all of Seale
skins, with a keel of wood within the skinne; the proportion of them is
like a Spanish shallop, saue only they be flat in the bottome, and sharp
at both endes” (p.&nbsp;621, 1576). Again: “They haue two sorts of boats
made of leather, set out on the inner side with quarters of wood,
artificially tyed with thongs of the same; the greater sort are not much
unlike our wherries, wherein sixteene or twenty men may sitte; they have
for a sayle, drest the guttes of such beasts as they kill, very fine and
thinne, which they sewe together; the other boate is but for one man to
sitte and rowe in, with one oare” (p.&nbsp;628, 1577).</p>

For example, Lyon says that at Fury and Hecla Straits the runners are
coated with ice by mixing snow and fresh water (Journal, p.&nbsp;235);
(See also Parry, 2d Voyage, p.&nbsp;515). At Cumberland Gulf “they pour
warmed blood on the under surface of the bone shoeing; some use water,
but this does not last nearly so long as the blood and is more apt to
chip off.” Kumlien, Contributions, p.&nbsp;42; (See also Hall, Arctic
Researches, p.&nbsp;582). Around Repulse Bay they ice the runners by
squirting over them water which has been warmed in the mouth, putting on
successive layers till they get a smooth surface. This is renewed the
first thing every morning. Gilder, Schwatka’s Search, p.&nbsp;66.
A&nbsp;native of the eastern shore of Labrador, according to Sir John
Richardson (Searching Expedition, vol. 2, p.&nbsp;82), applied to the
runners coat after coat of earth or clay tempered with hot water, and
then washed the runners with water, polishing the ice with his naked
hand. MacFarlane in his MS. notes speaks of covering the sled runners
with “earth, water, and ice” in the Mackenzie region. Petitot
(Monographie, etc., p. <span class = "smallroman">XVII</span>) says the
runners in the Mackenzie and Anderson district are shod with “un
bourrelet de limon et de glace,” which has to be often renewed.
Nordenskiöld says that at Pitlekaj “the runners, before the start, are
carefully covered with a layer of ice from two to three millimeters in
thickness by repeatedly pouring water over them,” (Vega, vol. 2,
p.&nbsp;94), and according to Wrangell (Narrative, etc., p.&nbsp;101,
footnote) it is the common custom in northern Siberia to pour water over
the runners every evening to produce a thin crust of ice.</p>

Schwatka, in “Nimrod in the North,” (p. 159) describes a practice among
the “Netschillik,” of King William’s Land, which appears very much like
this, though his description is somewhat obscure in details. It is as
follows: “We found the runners shod with pure ice. Trenches the length
of the sledge are dug in the ice, and into these the runners are lowered
some two or three inches, yet not touching the bottom of the trench by
fully the same distance. Water is then poured in and allowed to freeze,
and when the sledge is lifted out it is shod with shoes of perfectly
pure and transparent ice.” Strangely enough, these curious ice shoes are
not mentioned by Schwatka’s companions, Gilder and Klutschak, nor by
Schwatka himself in his paper on the “Netschillik” in <i>Science</i>,
although Klutschak describes and figures a sledge made wholly of ice
among the Netsillingmiut. (“Als Eskimo, etc.” p.&nbsp;76). Also referred
to by Boas (“Central Eskimo,” p.&nbsp;533).</p>

<p><a name = "note471" id = "note471" href = "#tag471">471</a>.
The word used was “kau-kau.” Perhaps it referred to a seal for food, as
the sledge appears very like one described by Hooper (Corwin Report,
p.&nbsp;105) as used on the “Arctic Coast.” “When sealing on solid ice a
small sled is sometimes used, the runners of which are made of walrus
tusks. It is perhaps 16 inches long by 14 inches wide and 3 inches high.
It is used in dragging the carcass of the seal over the ice.”</p>

<p class = "continue">We, however, never saw such sleds used for
dragging seals. This one may have been imported from farther south. See
also, Beechey, Voyage, etc., p.&nbsp;251, where he speaks of seeing at
Kotzebue Sound, a&nbsp;drawing on ivory of “a&nbsp;seal dragged home on
a small sledge.”</p>

Descriptions of Eskimo festivals are to be found in Egede’s Greenland,
p.&nbsp;152, and Crantz, History of Greenland, vol. 1, p.&nbsp;175,
where he mentions the sun feast held at the winter solstice. This very
likely corresponds to the December festival at Point Barrow. If the
latter be really a rite instituted by the ancestors of the present
Eskimo when they lived in lower latitudes to celebrate the winter
solstice, it is easy to understand why it should be held at about the
same time by the people of Kotzebue Sound, as stated by Dr. Simpson, op.
cit., p.&nbsp;262, where, as he says, the reindeer might be successfully
pursued throughout the winter. It is much more likely, considering the
custom in Greenland, that this is the reason for having the festival at
this season than that the time should be selected by the people at Point
Barrow as a season when “hunting or fishing can not well be attended
to,” as Simpson thinks. We should remember that this is the very time of
the year that the seal netting is at its height at Point Barrow. See

Compare Nordenskiöld’s account of the comparative cleanliness of the
Chukch dwellings at Pitlekaj: “On the other hand it may be stated that
in order not to make a stay in the confined tent chamber too
uncomfortable certain rules are strictly observed. Thus, for instance,
it is not permitted in the interior of the tent to spit on the floor,
but this must be done into a vessel which, in case of necessity, is used
as a night utensil. In every outer tent there lies a specially curved
reindeer horn, with which snow is removed from the clothes; the outer
<i>pesk</i> is usually put off before one goes into the inner tent, and
the shoes are carefully freed from snow. The carpet of walrus skins
which covers the floor of the inner tent is accordingly dry and clean.
Even the outer tent is swept clean and free from loose snow, and the
snow is daily shoveled away from the tent doors with a spade of
whalebone. Every article, both in the outer and inner tent, is laid in
its proper place, and so on.” (Vega, vol. 2, p.&nbsp;104.)</p>

Greenland, Holm, Geografisk Tidskrift, vol. 8, p.&nbsp;98, and Scoresby,
Voyage to Northern Whalefishery, p.&nbsp;213 (where he speaks of finding
on the east coast of Greenland graves <i>dug</i> and covered with slabs
of stone. <i>Digging</i> graves is very unusual among the Eskimo, as the
nature of the ground on which they live usually forbids it. Parry
mentions something similar at Iglulik: “The body was laid in a regular,
but shallow grave, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* covered with flat pieces of
limestone” (Second Voyage, p.&nbsp;551); Lyon, Journal, p.&nbsp;268

at the old Eskimo cemetery near the Hudson Bay post of Rigolette,
Hamilton Inlet, on the Labrador coast. Chappel, however, saw a body
“closely wrapt in skins and laid in a sort of a gully,” Hudson’s Bay,
p.&nbsp;113 (north shore Hudson Strait), and Davis’s account of what he
saw in Greenland is as follows: “We found on shore three dead people,

wrapped about them.” Hakluyt, Voyages, 1589, p.&nbsp;788.</p>

more especially a whale, was captured, it was considered common
property, and as indiscriminately belonging to every one who might come
and assist in flensing it, whatever place he belonged to and whether he
had any share in capturing the animal or not.” (Greenland). Gilder
(Schwatka’s Search, p.&nbsp;190) says that on the northwest shore of
Hudson Bay all who arrive while a walrus is being cut up are entitled to
a share of it, though the man who struck it has the first choice of
pieces. At East Cape, Siberia, the Krause Brothers learned: “Wird

and his head between his legs. A&nbsp;song was sung by the audience, and
the angekok invoked his tornak, beating on the skin and the drum. The
